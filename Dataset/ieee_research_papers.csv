0,0,Bargaining Game Based Time Scheduling Scheme for Ambient Backscatter Communications,/document/9615057/,2021,['Sungwook Kim'],0,"Backscatter communications have been acknowledged as an essential key technology in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Considering the fact that it needs the coordination from network agents, cooperative bargaining theory is an effective method to strike an appropriate system performance. In this paper, we investigate time scheduling algorithms for a backscatter-aided radio-frequency (RF) powered cognitive radio (CR) network, where multiple secondary transmitters can switch among the backscatter, the energy harvest, and active data transmission modes. Our objective is to maximize the RF-CR system performance while exploring the mutual benefits to leverage a reciprocal consensus between different control issues. According to the ideas of two different bargaining solutions - 
modified Nash bargaining solution
 and 
equitable Nash bargaining solution
, we design a new dual bargaining game model to effectively share the limited time resources. The main novelty of our proposed approach is its adaptability, flexibility and responsiveness to current RF-CR system conditions. At last, numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, and we demonstrate the benefits of our dual bargaining game approach."
1,1,The Use of Tangible User Interfaces in K12 Education Settings: A Systematic Mapping Study,/document/9721879/,2022,"['José A. Gallud', 'Ricardo Tesoriero', 'Maria D. Lozano', 'Victor M. R. Penichet', 'Habib M. Fardoun']",0,"Tangible User Interfaces have enriched and expanded the user experience when interacting with computers and smart devices. The monopoly of graphical user interfaces has been broken thanks to the emergence of new complementary technologies that allow for new ways of interacting with computer systems, such as tangible interaction, among others. Due to the scope and number of research articles addressing the Tangible User Interface that have been published, it can now be considered an interaction mechanism that is relatively mature and integrated within society. However, while the application of tangible interfaces in different areas is described as a success, there are only a limited number of research articles about their impact on education and learning systems. As a result, it is difficult to show the actual impact of Tangible User Interface technology in K12 education settings. This study tries to fill this gap by performing a systematic mapping study that shows the current state of research on the impact of this technology in these settings, analyzing the findings and identifying the main advances and limitations of this novel technology."
2,2,Transient Surface Charge Characteristics of DC-GIL Insulator Under Thermal-Electric Coupled Fields,/document/9714376/,2022,"['Xiaolong Li', 'Songling Han', 'Mingde Wan', 'Wen Wang', 'Zhenxin Geng', 'Xin Lin']",0,"The insulator in direct current gas-insulated transmission lines (DC-GIL) would suffer discharge risk due to surface charge accumulation under thermal-electric coupled fields. In this paper, the transient surface charge accumulation characteristics of a basin-type DC-GIL insulator is investigated via finite element method based on a three-dimension horizontally installed GIL model. The stationary temperature distribution of the model is obtained and then applied to the transient simulation of charge. Weak form partial differential equation is employed to deal with the ion transportation equation. Equations and parameters in the simulation are optimized to reduce the computing memory and time. Results indicate that the charge accumulation is accelerated due to the promotion of conduction through the insulator under thermal gradient. Higher charge density is obtained under thermal gradient. And the surface charge density of the convex surface is higher due to the promoted conduction. The highest field strength increases and the corresponding location moves along the convex surface during the transient process. This could attribute to the influence of transient charge behavior under thermal gradient on the electric field distribution. This study indicates that the thermal gradient and transient charge accumulation should be considered when dealing with the insulation characteristics of DC-GIL with insulators."
3,3,Electromagnetic Vibration Characteristics Analysis of a Squirrel-Cage Induction Motor Under Different Loading Conditions,/document/8918234/,2019,"['Defeng Kong', 'Zhijun Shuai', 'Wanyou Li', 'Donghua Wang']",3,"Electromagnetic vibration is an important excitation source for squirrel-cage induction motors. However, the electromagnetic vibration under various loadings has not been sufficiently analyzed. It is proposed in this paper that the electromagnetic vibration of motors under different loads can be obtained by analyzing the amplitude of the electromagnetic force wave. The Maxwell tensor method is employed to derive the spatial and temporal distributions of the radial force. This paper also calculates the radial force using the finite element method and decodes the calculated results using two dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) to determine the amplitude of the electromagnetic force at the spatial order under different loads. In addition, through the modal analysis of the stator core, it can be concluded that in the case of nonresonance, the vibration response increases when the electromagnetic force of the first-order and second-order rotor slot harmonic increases. Finally, the conclusion is verified by separating the electromagnetic vibration of the motor using a vibration test rig."

5,5,Dynamic Order-Based Scheduling Algorithms for Automated Retrieval System in Smart Warehouses,/document/9625637/,2021,"['Jialei Liu', 'Soung-Yue Liew', 'Boon Yaik Ooi', 'Donghong Qin']",0,"In typical e-commerce warehouse operations, upon receiving the orders from customers, the purchased items need to be retrieved from shelves and then packaged accordingly for delivery. To automate and speed up the item retrieval process, a Smart Warehouse usually employs a management system, called the Automated Retrieval System (ARS), to control and schedule the retrieval jobs. The working principle of ARS is crucial to the Smart Warehouse because it will have a great impact on the subsequent downstream processes. In short, all the items in a particular order should be considered as an integral part; if one of these items encounters a much larger retrieval delay than others do, then the entire order may experience an unnecessary latency. In the past, the integrality of order has not received much attention for the parallel retrieval process of multiple stackers. To take this into account, this paper proposes using an Order Tag to label all the items that belong to the same order for retrieval job scheduling. The way of calculating the Order Tags will then determine the scheduling discipline of the ARS. With the objectives of minimizing the average delay and ensuring the fairness, two algorithms are proposed. They are named as Dynamic Order-Based (DOB) and Dynamic Order-Based with Threshold (DOBT) Scheduling Algorithms, respectively. Compared with the First-Come-First-Serve and other approaches, the simulation results show that DOB and DOBT are able to reduce the average order retrieval delay by at least 30%, and generate less backlog pressure to the downstream operations."
6,6,A Matheuristic Algorithm for the Multiple-Depot Vehicle and Crew Scheduling Problem,/document/9617637/,2021,"['Emiliana Mara Lopes Simões', 'Lucas De Souza Batista', 'Marcone Jamilson Freitas Souza']",0,"This work addresses the multiple-depot vehicle and crew scheduling problem (MDVCSP). In MDVCSP, we deal with two NP-hard problems in an integrated way: the multiple-depot vehicle scheduling problem (MDVSP) and the crew scheduling problem (CSP). For solving the MDVCSP, we define the vehicles’ operational routine and the workdays of the crews of a public bus transport system with multiple depots. Given the difficulty of solving real-world instances of the MDVCSP using exact mathematical methods, we propose a matheuristic algorithm for solving it. This matheuristic algorithm combines two strategies into an iterated local search (ILS) based framework: a branch-and-bound algorithm for solving the MDVSP and a variable neighborhood descent (VND) based algorithm for treating the associated CSPs. We compared the proposed ILS-MDVCSP with five approaches in the literature that use the same benchmark test instances. We also solved a real-world problem of one of Brazil’s largest cities. For this problem, we proposed a formulation based on a time-space network to address the MDVSP subproblem. The results obtained showed the effectiveness of ILS-MDVCSP, mainly to deal with real-world and large-scale problems. The algorithm was able to solve the largest instances from the literature, for which there was no reported solution. Regarding the run time, as the instances’ size increases, our approach becomes substantially less costly than the others from the literature. For the Brazilian instances, the ILS-MDVCSP saved, on average, the use of 12 vehicles per day and reduced by up to 15% the daily operational time of the vehicles."

9,9,Robust Charging Schedule for Autonomous Electric Vehicles With Uncertain Covariates,/document/9627905/,2021,"['Yongsheng Cao', 'Yongquan Wang']",0,"Autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) will become an inevitable trend in the future transportation network and have an important impact on the power grid. It is difficult to find the optimal distributed charging solution for AEVs to minimize the system cost with some uncertainties. In this paper, we investigate an AEVs charging and discharging problem with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services. We aim to minimize the total electricity cost and battery degradation cost of AEVs and charging station batteries with V2G services, which takes the random arrival and departure of AEVs into account. We first propose a distributed charging framework of AEVs and charging stations by clustering method with the constraint of limited AEVs for each charging station in a region and formulate a distributed offline optimization problem. Then we formulate a distributed online charging optimization problem and propose a distributed online AEV charging scheduling (DOAS) algorithm to get an optimal charging solution. To study a more practical case, we reformulate the distributed online optimization problem with the uncertainties from base loads, renewable energy and charging demands. Furthermore, to improve the time efficiency of DOAS algorithm, we reduce the dimension of the distributed problem and design a dimension-reduction DOAS (DDOAS) algorithm. To seek a robust solution with some uncertainties, we propose a DDOAS algorithm with DRO based on Wasserstein distance (DDODW). Simulation results show that DOAS and DDOAS algorithms can have a close-to-optimal charging cost and a significantly less battery degradation cost of charging stations, compared with centralized online charging scheduling algorithm and DDOAS algorithm is more time-efficient than DOAS algorithm. The proposed DDODW algorithm can provide a robust solution for the energy schedule"

 shadow-fading channel under the wiretapping attempts of multiple eavesdroppers. In order to improve the secrecy level, the best relay selection strategy among multiple relays is employed. Performance analysis is carried out based on the mathematical modeling in terms of analytical expressions of non-zero secrecy capacity probability, secure outage probability, and ergodic secrecy capacity over multicast relay networks. Capitalizing on those expressions, the effects of system parameters, i.e., fading, shadowing, the number of antennas, destination receivers, eavesdroppers, and relays, on the secrecy performance are investigated. Numerical results show that the detrimental impacts caused by fading and shadowing can be remarkably mitigated using the well-known opportunistic relaying technique. Moreover, the proposed model unifies secrecy analysis of several classical models, thereby exhibiting enormous versatility than the existing works. Finally, all the numerical results are authenticated utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations."

Its ability to accurately solve complex problems is employed in vision research to learn deep neural models for a variety of tasks, including security critical applications. However, it is now known that deep learning is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate its predictions by introducing visually imperceptible perturbations in images and videos. Since the discovery of this phenomenon in 2013, it has attracted significant attention of researchers from multiple sub-fields of machine intelligence. In 2018, we published the first-ever review of the contributions made by the computer vision community in adversarial attacks on deep learning (and their defenses). Many of those contributions have inspired new directions in this area, which has matured significantly since witnessing the first generation methods. Hence, as a legacy sequel of our first literature survey, this review article focuses on the advances in this area since 2018. We thoroughly discuss the first generation attacks and comprehensively cover the modern attacks and their defenses appearing in the prestigious sources of computer vision and machine learning research. Besides offering the most comprehensive literature review of adversarial attacks and defenses to date, the article also provides concise definitions of technical terminologies for the non-experts. Finally, it discusses challenges and future outlook of this direction based on the literature since the advent of this research direction."
13,13,Multicriteria Classifier Ensemble Learning for Imbalanced Data,/document/9706443/,2022,"['Weronika Węgier', 'Michał Koziarski', 'Michał Woźniak']",0,"One of the vital problems with the imbalanced data classifier training is the definition of an optimization criterion. Typically, since the exact cost of misclassification of the individual classes is unknown, combined metrics and loss functions that roughly balance the cost for each class are used. However, this approach can lead to a loss of information, since different trade-offs between class misclassification rates can produce similar combined metric values. To address this issue, this paper discusses a multi-criteria ensemble training method for the imbalanced data. The proposed method jointly optimizes

The proposed approach was evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets and compared with the single-criterion approach (where the selected criterion was one of the chosen metrics). The results of the experiments confirmed the usefulness of the obtained method, which on the one hand guarantees good quality, i.e., not worse than the one obtained with the use of single-criterion optimization, and on the other hand, offers the user the opportunity to choose the solution that best meets their expectations regarding the trade-off between errors on the minority and the majority class."

We consider missions with the following goals: guided missile avoidance, shortest-path flight and formation flight. For reinforcement learning, the representation of the current agent state is important. We propose a novel method of using the coordinates and angle of a CUAV to effectively represent its state. Furthermore, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm with enhanced exploration through amplification of the imitation effect (AIE). This algorithm consists of self-imitation learning and random network distillation algorithms. We assert that these two algorithms complement each other and that combining them amplifies the imitation effect for exploration. Empirical results show that the proposed AIE approach is highly effective at finding a CUAV's shortest-flight path while avoiding enemy missiles. Test results confirm that with our method, a single CUAV reaches its target from its starting point 95% of the time and a squadron of four simultaneously operating CUAVs reaches the target 70% of the time."

In this work, we introduce a new detection scheme for HTTP flooding attack by using Susceptible-Infective-Susceptible (SIS) model of an infectious disease which used in dynamic systems. During any time interval, the server can measure various values of attributes for its users like number of total connections, number of open connections and number of closed connections. These values can be used to detect any abnormal behavior or infected connections in a server by mapping this attributes with SIS model. Thus we can get suspected and infected connections during every time interval. Extensive trace driven simulation has been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of its detection rate and probability of false positive."
18,18,Hiding Secret Messages in Living Cells in the Age of Next-Generation Sequencing,/document/8937535/,2019,['Mei Chen'],0,"Hiding secret messages (SMs) based on DNA technologies plays a critical role in DNA computing. In recent years, scientists have hidden SMs at a specific site in the plasmids of various living cells. Unfortunately, this strategy was proposed without considering the attack of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Nowadays, NGS, which is a revolutionary massively parallel sequencing technique, is developing rapidly. With the help of NGS, sequencing completely unknown genomes is becoming popular in various laboratories throughout the world. The ability to sequence completely unknown genomes is a major threat to existing hiding strategies in living cells. To prevent against the attack of NGS, this paper proposes a scheme to hide SMs in living cells (SHSM). Compared with previous studies, the main contribution of SHSM is changing the specific single hiding site into random multiple hiding sites through the application of seamless clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technique. In SHSM, SMs are hidden in living cells with different puzzling messages at different sites every time to prevent against the attack of NGS. To read the SM, high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing are used. A hash function is used to ensure the integrity of the message. These measures mean that an attacker would not be able to determine the location of the SM using NGS. The feasibility of SHSM was validated by a wet-lab experiment, and the security was demonstrated by the system's entropy. The author hopes this study will bring attention to the threat of NGS, and advance the development of hiding SMs in living cells."

Band', 'Amir Mosavi', 'Mohammad-Hassan Khooban']",0,"This multilevel inverter type summarizes an output voltage of medium voltage based on a series connection of power cells employing standard configurations of low-voltage components. The main problems of cascaded switched-capacitor multilevel inverters (CSCMLIs) are the harmful reverse flowing current of inductive loads, the large number of switches, and the surge current of the capacitors. As the number of switches increases, the reliability of the inverter decreases. To address these issues, a new CSCMLI is proposed using two modules containing asymmetric DC sources to generate 13 levels. The main novelty of the proposed configuration is the reduction of the number of switches while increasing the maximum output voltage. Despite the many similarities, the presented topology differs from similar topologies. Compared to similar structures, the direction of some switches is reversed, leading to a change in the direction of current flow. By incorporating the lowest number of semiconductors, it was demonstrated that the proposed inverter has the lowest cost function among similar inverters. The role of switched-capacitor inrush current in the selection of switch, diode, and DC source for inverter operation in medium and high voltage applications is presented. The inverter performance to supply the inductive loads is clarified. Comparison of the simulation and experimental results validates the effectiveness of the proposed inverter topology, showing promising potentials in photovoltaic, buildings, and domestic applications.

The structural strength degradation factor (DF) would be used to define structural damage information entropy (SDIE) vector. The structural damage cause and effect model is developed in a probability sense. A fatigue index is adopted for damage assessment, and a causal strength index is proposed to locate the most likely damage cause. A sandstone-truss structure experiment was conducted to show that the proposed method is effective for damage evaluation and the experimental results provide strong support. This is a statistical damage identification method based on causal logic uncertainty, meaning a complicated mechanics calculation can be avoided."

We can state the key contributions of the paper with three folds. Firstly, we propose the SpID-N model covering the higher-order internal dynamics which cause the peaks in the casualties. Secondly, we parametrize the non-pharmacological policies such as the curfews on people with chronic disease, people age over 65, people age under 20, restrictions on the weekends and holidays, and closure of the schools and universities. Thirdly, we explicitly incorporate the internal and coupled dynamics of the model with these multi-dimensional non-pharmacological policies. The corresponding higher-order and strongly coupled model has utterly unknown parameters and we construct a batch type Least Square (LS) based optimization algorithm to learn these unknown parameters from the available data. The parametric model and the predicted future casualties are analyzed extensively."
23,23,Credit-Based Distributed Real-Time Energy Storage Sharing Management,/document/8938754/,2019,"['Hailing Zhu', 'Khmaies Ouahada']",6,"In this paper, energy storage sharing among a group of cooperative households with integrated renewable generations in a grid-connected microgrid is studied. In such a microgrid, a group of households, who are willing to cooperatively operate a shared energy storage via a central coordinator, aims to minimize their long term time-averaged costs, by jointly taking into account the operational constraints of the shared energy storage, the stochastic solar power generations and the time-varying load demands from all households, as well as the fluctuating electricity prices. This energy management problem, which comprises storage management and load control, is first formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. Based on the Lyapunov optimization theory, a distributed real-time sharing control algorithm is proposed to solve the constrained stochastic programming problem without requiring any statistical knowledge of the stochastic renewable energy generations and the uncertain power loads. The credit-based distributed sharing algorithm, in which each household independently solves a simple convex optimization problem without requiring any statistics of the system, is designed to quickly adapt to the system dynamics while facilitating a fair allocation of the shared energy storage with respect to individual households' energy contributions. The performance of the proposed low-complexity distributed sharing algorithm is evaluated via theoretical analysis. Numerical simulations using a practical system setup are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed sharing control algorithm in terms of energy cost saving and fairness. The simulation results show that the proposed credit-based distributed sharing algorithm can save power consumption cost by coordinating the use of the shared battery among households in a fair manner while improving the utilization of renewable energy generation."

A small-scale subjective study is carried out to assess the effectiveness of our proposal. In particular, the proposed disagreement measure is shown to be extremely effective in determining whether the quality of any given processed video sequence (PVS) can be accurately predicted by the VQMs. This type of information is particularly useful for identifying video sequences that are likely to degrade the end-user’s quality of experience (QoE). Our proposal is also useful in selecting the most effective PVSs to be employed in a subjective test. We show that the proposed disagreement measure can be effectively predicted from bitstream features. This establishes a link between the capability to accurately assess the quality of a PVS and the way it is encoded. In addition, an analysis is conducted to compare the performances of some well-known and widely used open-source metrics and two proprietary metrics. The two proprietary metrics are used by a large media company for enhancing its delivery pipeline. The outcome of this comparison highlights the suitability of the open-source VQM, Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), as a good benchmark quality measure for both the industrial and academic environments."
25,25,Selective Encryption of the Versatile Video Coding Standard,/document/9706210/,2022,"['Mousa Farajallah', 'Guillaume Gautier', 'Wassim Hamidouche', 'Olivier Déforges', 'Safwan El Assad']",0,"versatile video coding (VVC) is the next generation video coding standard developed by the joint video experts team (JVET) and released in July 2020. VVC introduces several new coding tools providing a significant coding gain over the high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard. It is well known that increasing the coding efficiency adds more dependencies in the video bitstream making format-compliant encryption with the standard more challenging. In this paper we tackle the problem of selective encryption of the VVC standard in format-compliant and constant bitrate. These two constraints ensure that the encrypted bitstream can be decoded by any VVC decoder while the bitrate remains unchanged by the encryption. The selective encryption of all possible VVC syntax elements is investigated. A new algorithm is proposed to encrypt in format-compliant and constant bitrate the transform coefficients (TCs) together with other syntax elements at the level of the entropy encoder. The proposed solution was integrated and assessed under the VVC reference software model version 6.0. Experimental results showed that encryption drastically decreases the video quality while the encryption is robust against several types of attacks. The encryption space is estimated in the range of 15% to 26% of the bitstream size resulting in a lightweight encryption process. The web page of this work is publicly available at

Ever-increasing data usage requires them to be smaller, faster, and easier to fabricate. Graphene with exceptional properties has been emerging as a material for such next-generation silicon photonic modulators, and a variety of graphene-based photonic or plasmonic modulators have been realized and verified. However, due to weak light-graphene interaction in them, they have a modulation depth smaller than 0.16 dB/μm, which is similar to those of existing germanium-silicon electroabsorption modulators. This work reports a graphene-covered hybrid plasmonic waveguide that has truly strong light-graphene interaction. The hybrid plasmonic waveguide is realized with standard CMOS technology and efficiently coupled to a conventional Si waveguide. To prove the strong light-graphene interaction, solid-electrolyte gating is used to modulate the intensity of the waveguide although its modulation speed is slow. It is demonstrated that the waveguide has a remarkably large modulation depth of 0.276 dB/μm even though just one single-layer graphene covers the waveguide. This demonstration opens the door to the waveguide covered with a graphene-oxide-graphene capacitor, which may have a larger modulation depth and a large 3-dB bandwidth, and it is theoretically analyzed. This work may be the solid base for a graphene-based silicon photonic modulator which is theoretically expected to surpass current silicon photonic modulators."

This solution is validated by implementing a digital mobile radio (DMR) standard radio hotspot and a video streaming server in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that conveys a device with scarce resources in order to minimize power consumption. To achieve a fast and flexible deployment of the envisioned services, a virtualization-based approach is proposed. Namely, a Kubernetes orchestrator is used to manage the life-cycle of services deployed on a small resource device, endowing the architecture with scalability and management flexibility. This article describes the executed performance tests that measured key parameters such as deployment time and recovery time after disconnection. Highly promising results were obtained, showing that the proposed architecture can be deployed in less than 4 minutes and can recover from network disconnections in less than 10 seconds. Thus, the performance, reliability and flexibility of the overall solution are demonstrated."

However, the observational quality of the data has made it challenging to the quality control of meteorological data. In an effort to overcome this challenge, a random sampling-arithmetic mean (RS-AM) method based on the random observation method is proposed to solve the problem. Firstly, the reason why the arithmetic mean is not ideal for truth estimation is proved in the paper. Secondly, the method evaluates the goodness of fit between the expected distribution and the sampling distribution by repeatedly extracting the random observation vector based on the random sampling model, to find the random observation vector closest to the expected distribution. Then, the distance between the median and arithmetic mean of each set of claims is calculated by the distance formula, and the claims with the minimum distance are selected. The random extraction is continued on the selected set of claims until the stop condition is met. Finally, the truth is calculated by the method of arithmetic mean from the selected claims. Moreover, the convergence of this method is proved by theoretical derivation. Experimental results show that the proposed RS-AM method can effectively solve the problem of data observation quality. And, compared with the conflict resolution on heterogeneous data (CRH) method, the RS-AM method reduces 1.5% on MSE and 2.9% on RMSE while ensuring the error rate is basically the same."

Firstly, desired error trajectories are constructed for implementing error tracking strategy in the robotic systems, so as to relax the requirement of zero initial errors, which is usually assumed to be met in traditional iterative learning control algorithms. Secondly, with the help of reasonable parameterization to the robotic dynamics, the adaptive iterative control law is designed by using Lyapunov approach. Projection-free combined time-domain and iteration-domain adaptive learning strategy is adopted to estimate the unknown time-invariant parametric uncertainties, and difference learning strategy is adopted to estimate unknown time-varying parametric uncertainties. As the iteration number increases, the system error follows its desired error trajectory over the whole interval. As a result, system state can perfectly track the reference signal in the predetermined part interval. In the end, several numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed control scheme."
31,31,Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Document Image Classification,/document/9638456/,2021,"['Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui', 'Andreas Dengel', 'Sheraz Ahmed']",0,"Supervised learning, despite being extremely effective, relies on expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone annotations. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a strong alternate to supervised learning in a range of different domains as collecting a large amount of unlabeled data can be achieved by simply crawling the internet. These self-supervised methods automatically discover features relevant to represent an input example by using self-defined proxy tasks. In this paper, we question the potential of commonly employed purely supervised training (starting either from ImageNet pretrained networks or pure random initialization) in contrast to self-supervised representations that can be learned directly using self-supervised representation learning methods on large document image datasets. For this purpose, we leverage a large-scale document image collection (RVL-CDIP) to train ResNet-50 image encoder using two different self-supervision methods (SimCLR and Barlow Twins). Employing a linear classifier on top of self-supervised embeddings from ResNet-50 results in an accuracy of 86.75% as compared to 71.43% from the corresponding ImageNet pretrained embeddings. Similarly, evaluating on Tobacco-3482 dataset using self-supervised embeddings from ResNet-50 yields an accuracy of 88.52% in contrast to 74.16% from the corresponding ImageNet pretrained embeddings. We show that in the case of limited labeled data, this wide gap in performance between self-supervised and fully supervised models persists even after fine-tuning pretrained models. However, a significant reduction in this gap is observed with an increasing amount of data including the case where the model is trained from scratch. Our results show that representations learned using self-supervised representation learning techniques are a viable option for document image classification, specifically in the context of limited labeled data, which is a usual restriction in industrial use cases."

One of the efficient and effective methods for power losses reduction is distribution system reconfiguration (DSR). In this way, the network configuration is changed based on a specific power demand that has been already predicted by load forecasting techniques. The ohmic loss level in distribution system is affected by energy demand level, this is while an error in load forecasting can influence losses. Accordingly, including load uncertainty in DSR formulation is essential but this issue should not lead to change of the reconfiguration results significantly (i.e. the model should be robust). This paper presents a robust and efficient model for considering load uncertainty in network reconfiguration that is simple enough to implement in available commercial software packages and it is precise enough to find accurate solutions with low computational time. The analysis of results shows high efficiency and robustness of the proposed model for reconfiguration of distribution systems under demand uncertainty."

These reviews become the main source of information for both customers and decision-makers in this field. Any customer who is seeking such places will check their reviews first, which usually affect their final choice. In addition, customers’ experiences can be enhanced by utilizing other customers’ suggestions. Consequently, customers’ reviews can influence the success of restaurant business since it is considered the final judgment of the overall quality of any restaurant. Thus, decision-makers need to analyze their customers’ underlying sentiments in order to meet their expectations and improve the restaurants’ services, in terms of food quality, ambiance, price range, and customer service. The number of reviews available for various products and services has dramatically increased these days and so has the need for automated methods to collect and analyze these reviews.

However, in this work a user engagement-based approach is taken for evaluating the utilitarian and hedonic attitudes of the users towards the continued usage scenario. This is augmented with additional contextual constructs like trust, privacy risk, and satisfaction. At present, there is little empirical evidence of user engagement with voice-assistants. Moreover, the present work focuses on the continuance usage of late adopters by considering two unique personal factors (slowness of adoption and skepticism). By evaluating the engagement aspect of the laggard group, the current findings contribute to theory by providing a better understanding of how the proposed antecedents determine the continuance intention.

36,36,Improved Ground Target Detecting System Based on Both Miniaturized FMCW Radar and Radiometer,/document/9718282/,2022,"['Myung-Suk Jung', 'Kyung-Tae Kim']",0,"The frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar is generally applied in ground target detecting devices mounted on small shells or projectiles because of its compact size. However, the FMCW radar often produces false alarms when detecting ground targets surrounded by heavy clutter. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a ground target detection system based on both the miniaturized FMCW radar and the total power radiometer (TPR), consisting of the common millimeter-wave (MMW) front ends and an antenna. However, its intermediate frequency (IF) parts are separated using different frequency bands to miniaturize the entire system. The minimum detectable temperature (MDT) increases and the sensitivity is thus degraded because the TPR for the hybrid sensor inevitably includes an undesirable transmitter section owing to the widespread usage of the front ends with the radar. The proposed system employs optimization of the physical path delay and duplexing the IF band for the TPR and FMCW radar to improve the sensitivity of the TPR in the proposed hybrid sensors and reduce the system noise. The system includes a matching circuit and a voltage doubler to improve the sensitivity of the detector. Therefore, the MDT of TPR in the proposed hybrid system can be reduced to 47.5 K from 734.6 K in the initial design. The drop test demonstrates that the proposed hybrid sensor can reduce false alarms when compared to using either the FMCW radar or only the TPR."

Thus, we compare the computational effort and solution quality of a metamodel-based system design. As a use case for this comparison, we define a particular automotive powertrain design task and formulate it as a multi-objective optimization problem with two design objectives and three design variables. First, we solve this use case with a physics-based vehicle model, which is a typical detailed model for powertrain design. Second, we solve the same problem with metamodels. Here, we create several metamodels with different approximation accuracies to analyze the trade-off between computational effort and solution quality. The metamodel solution with the smallest deviation (<1 %) is computed about 9 times faster than the benchmark solution on the target computer used. The fastest metamodel solution is about 42 times faster and causes deviations between 5 % to 10 % compared to the benchmark. This case study can be used to develop metamodel schemes for other applications that provide fast yet accurate solutions. We also demonstrate the practicality of metamodels in real-world system design by comparing the computational effort quantitatively for the first time."

However, the need for heavy computing tasks in most traditional DOA algorithms, e.g., multiple signal classification (MUSIC), makes their engineering practicality significantly compromised in satellite communication systems. The neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) can quickly search for appropriate topologies and weights of neural network functions, but its computational complexity is still too high for satellite systems. This paper proposes a modified NEAT architecture featuring a recurrent structure (RNEAT) that only needs a small number of phase components of the received signal covariance matrix as inputs to reduce the complexity and simplify the neural network architecture. The proposed RNEAT incorporated with multiple signal classification (RNEAT-MUSIC) features low complexity to achieve high resolution and low complexity simultaneously. Validation has been done by applying the proposed method in a two-dimensional direction of arrival estimation (2D-DOA) problem. Results show that the proposed RNEAT-MUSIC efficiently restricts the scanning region before forwarding the covariance matrix to the MUSIC stage. Consequently, the computational workload is reduced by 3/4 compared with the traditional 2D-MUSIC algorithm while maintaining satisfactory DOA resolution."

We divide the problem into the prediction of the future velocity profile (i.e. driver intention estimation) and the online optimal control of the hybrid powertrain following a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme. The velocity prediction is based on a bio-inspired driver model, which is compared on various datasets with two alternative prediction algorithms adopted in the literature. The online optimal control problem addresses both the fuel consumption and the preservation of the battery life using an equivalent cost given the estimated speed profile (i.e. guaranteeing the desired performance). The battery degradation is evaluated by means of a state-of-the-art electrochemical model. Both the predictor and the Energy Management System (EMS) are evaluated in simulation using real driving data divided into 30 driving cycles from 10 drivers characterised by different driving styles. A comparison of the EMS performances is carried out on two different benchmarks based on an offline optimization, in one case on the entire dataset length and in the second on an ideal prediction using two different receding horizon lengths. The proposed online system, composed of the velocity prediction algorithm and the optimal control MPC scheme, shows comparable performances with the previous ideal benchmarks in terms of fuel consumption and battery life preservation.

For example, RobustFill was proposed as an ML-based PBE method for string transformation by using long short-term memory (LSTM) as the sequential encoder–decoder model. However, an ML-based PBE method has not been developed for tabular transformations, which are used frequently in data analysis. Thus, in the present study, we propose an ML-based PBE method for tabular transformations. First, we consider the features of tabular transformations, which are more complex and data intensive than string transformations, and propose a new ML-based PBE method using the state-of-the-art Transformer sequential encoder–decoder model. To our knowledge, this is the first ML-based PBE method for tabular transformations. We also propose two decoding methods comprising multistep beam search and program validation-beam search, which are optimized for program generation, and thus generate correct programs with higher accuracy. Our evaluation results demonstrated that the Transformer-based PBE model performed much better than LSTM-based PBE when applied to tabular transformations. Furthermore, the Transformer-based model with the proposed decoding method performed better than the conventional PBE model using the search-based method."

Recently, knowledge graph (KG) embedding has gained massive attention as it can effectively provide side information for downstream tasks. However, most previous knowledge-based models do not take into account the structural characteristics of the triples in KGs, and only convert them into vector representations for direct accumulation, leading to deficiencies in knowledge extraction and knowledge fusion. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel deep model KCF-NET, which incorporates knowledge graph representations with context as the basis for predicting answers by leveraging capsule network to encode the intrinsic spatial relationship in triples of KG. In KCF-NET, we fine-tune BERT, a highly performance contextual language representation model, to capture complex linguistic phenomena. Besides, a novel fusion structure based on multi-head attention mechanism is designed to balance the weight of knowledge and context. To evaluate the knowledge expression and reading comprehension ability of our model, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple public datasets such as WN11, FB13, SemEval-2010 Task 8 and SQuAD. Experimental results show that KCF-NET achieves state-of-the-art results in both link prediction and MRC tasks with negligible parameter increase compared to BERT-Base, and gets competitive results in triple classification task with significantly reduced model size."

ACM is a decentralized scheduling approach which focuses on the production maximization goals per machine, and also pays attention to the production goals of all the machine networks involved in the smart factory. FEF scheduling scheme focuses on minimizing the tasks starvation rate and maximizing the machine utilization by efficiently using the machine slots. The proposed hybrid mechanism aims to efficiently plan tasks execution, maximize machines' resource utilization, maximize productivity, minimize production delays, efficiently handle exceptions and efficiently control smart factory actuators."

High spatial resolution images enable more accurate analysis and identification of land cover types. However, a higher spatial resolution also brings new challenges to the existing classification methods. In the low-level feature spaces of remote sensing images, it is difficult to improve classification performance by modifying classifiers. Probabilistic topic models can connect low-level features and high-level semantics of remote sensing images. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) models are representatives of probabilistic topic models. However, at present, probabilistic topic models are mainly adopted for scene classification and image retrieval in remote sensing image analysis only. In this study, multiscale segmentation was employed to construct bag-of-words (BoW) representations of high-resolution images. The segmented patches were then utilized as “image documents.” A structural topic model was used with an LDA model to import spatial information from the image documents at two levels: topical prevalence and topical content in the form of covariates. In this way, latent topic features in image documents can be more accurately deduced. The proposed method showed more satisfactory classification performance than standard LDA models and demonstrated a certain degree of robustness against the changes in the segmentation scale.

This causes additional losses, cost, inaccuracies, effort, and noise. Eliminating the need of a mechanical gear and the associated disadvantages, Transverse Flux Machines with their high torque density are a very promising alternative. Despite a high torque density and a high efficiency, these types of machines are not commonly used. Due to the complex structure, challenges with mechanical design, and modeling of the machine behavior arise. Additionally, there are high requirements for the inverter due to the low power factor. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art including the potentials and advantages but also the problems and hindrances of these types of machines. Relating to linear and rotary machines from research and industry, the machine is introduced with its history, application and classification. Further, the general technical aspects, the influence of materials for flux guidance, the methods of modeling, methods for a minimization of torque ripples, as well as methods for power factor improvement are presented."

Constructing an optimization model with several congestion levels, we introduce a new network called the multi-class time-expanded (MCTE) network having several exclusive arcs connecting the same tail and head nodes. The MCTE networks make both the MILP model and the heuristic algorithm reflect a realistic situation in congested networks. Considering MCTE networks makes the problem difficult to solve, which motivates us to develop an efficient heuristic algorithm. We test our heuristic algorithm using several real-world networks such as a multiplex cinema, a subway station, and a large-size complex shopping mall in addition to an artificial network for clear comparison between the proposed algorithm and the MILP approaches. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm runs fast and produces a near-optimal solution compared with those from MILP models with a commercial solver."

Integrating data from different omics provides an unprecedented opportunity to gain insight into disease mechanisms from different perspectives. However, integrative analysis and predictive modeling from multi-omics data are facing three major challenges: i) heavy noises; ii) the high dimensions compared to the small samples; iii) data heterogeneity. Current multi-omics data integration approaches have some limitations and are susceptible to heavy noise. In this paper, we present MSPL, a robust supervised multi-omics data integration method that simultaneously identifies significant multi-omics signatures during the integration process and predicts the cancer subtypes. The proposed method not only inherits the generalization performance of self-paced learning but also leverages the properties of multi-omics data containing correlated information to interactively recommend high-confidence samples for model training. We demonstrate the capabilities of MSPL using simulated data and five multi-omics biological datasets, integrating up three omics to identify potential biological signatures, and evaluating the performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in binary and multi-class classification problems. Our proposed model makes multi-omics data integration more systematic and expands its range of applications."

The reduction in RPL with DG and capacitors is evaluated using another analytical expression that relates power injections of DG and capacitors with RPL. An optimal power flow algorithm (OPF) is incorporated in the proposed method to consider the constraints of the distribution systems, DG, and capacitors. Various types of DG are considered, and their optimal power factors can be accurately computed while optimizing the sizes of capacitors in a simultaneous manner to reduce RPL.

It is noticed that in the detection stage, the output energy is mainly concentrated in the mainlobe region. Therefore, we decompose the receive filter as the cascade of a receive beamformer and a temporal filter. Then, under the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) constraint, a problem is formulated to realize a trade-off between the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) at the pulse compression output of mainlobe synthesized signal. A non-decreasing algorithm, which is the combination of sequential optimization algorithm and minorization-maximization (MM) method, is developed to solve this problem. Besides, in order to reduce computation burden, a special case is proposed, where we fix the temporal filter as the mainlobe synthesized signal. Then, another non-decreasing algorithm based on the MM method is proposed to solve the special case. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms can obtain high output SINR and low output ISL efficiently."

Nguyen', 'Duc-Thinh Pham', 'Sameer Alam']",0,"Aircraft trajectory prediction is a challenging problem in air traffic control, especially for conflict detection. Traditional trajectory predictors require a variety of inputs such as flight-plans, aircraft performance models, meteorological forecasts, etc. Many of these data are subjected to environmental uncertainties. Further, limited information about such inputs, especially the lack of aircraft tactical intent, makes trajectory prediction a challenging task. In this work, we propose a deep learning model that performs trajectory prediction by modeling and incorporating aircraft tactical intent. The proposed model adopts the encoder-decoder architecture and makes use of the convolutional layer as well as Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The proposed model does not require explicit information about aircraft performance and wind data. Results demonstrate that the provision of enriched aircraft intent, together with appropriate model design, could improve the prediction error up to 30% at a prediction horizon of 10 minutes (from 4.9 nautical miles to 3.4 nautical miles). The model also guarantees the mean error growth rate with increasing look-ahead time to be lower than 0.2 nautical miles per minute. In addition, the model offers a very low variance in the prediction, which satisfies the variance-standard specified by EUROCONTROL (EU Organization for Safety and Navigation of Air Traffic) for trajectory predictors. The proposed model also outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction model, where the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is reduced from 0.0203 to 0.0018 for latitude prediction, and from 0.0482 to 0.0021 for longitude prediction in a single prediction step of 15 seconds look-ahead.

The conventional grouping and pruning methods successfully reject the effect of dynamic objects in pose graph optimization (PGO). However, these methods sometimes fail when high-dynamic objects are dominant in the images captured by RGB-D sensors. Furthermore, once it is determined whether the features from dynamic objects are included in some nodes, the corresponding nodes are entirely removed even though these nodes partially include true constraints, which leads to an inaccurate PGO. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method with intra-grouping, inter-grouping, and selective pruning, called G2P-SLAM. Accordingly, our method successfully rejects false constraints from dynamic objects selectively, thus preserving true constraints from static objects as many as possible. As experimentally verified on both our own datasets and public datasets, our proposed method shows promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, experimental results corroborate that our G2P-SLAM enables robust PGO in both dynamic and low-dynamic environments."

White matter regions were found to have higher resistivity compared to grey matter regions. The heterogeneity associated with grey matter regions was lower than the white matter regions. Formalin-fixation was observed to increase the magnitude of resistivity measured while retaining the observed trend across the different regions of the brain and tumors. The study shows that the electrical resistivity could potentially be used as an additional biomarker for delineating normal from the tumor."

Previous studies on the establishment of group keys for fog computing architectures have high communication costs and cannot verify the authenticity of each entity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a mutual authentication group key establishment scheme for the fog computing architecture by using elliptic curve cryptography. After mutual authentication, the cloud server can transfer the computing overhead to the fog node, which will be responsible for authenticating the device group and distributing the established group session key. The group session key consists of the private key of each entity and some random and temporarily stored values. We prove that the established group session key is protected by the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary model. Finally, we evaluate performance based on calculation and communication costs. Compared with previous studies, the proposed scheme is lightweight and effective because it only involves elliptic curve operations and symmetric cryptographic operations."

The output voltage can be regulated by the FW-PT control strategy by using two or more sets of preset control pulse combinations, therefore it has the advantages of simple circuit implementation, no Network compensation and fast response speed.

This study describes experiments under actual post-disaster emergency rescue scenarios, for which the signal-to-noise ratio of UWB radar is seriously degraded owing to multipath effects and a complicated ruin environment. Four distinguishing features are extracted from aspects of wavelet entropy, correlation coefficient, and energy to classify humans from animals. Analysis of feature effectiveness showed that each feature could identify humans from animals individually. The largest difference between humans and animals was found in a feature which combines advantages of the correlation coefficient and energy simultaneously. There was no overlap between the human and animal values for this feature among the 20 sets of radar data collected. This is the first attempt to distinguish humans from animals in an actual post-disaster trapped condition, and it yielded four features of strong classification ability.

The generalizability of the proposed algorithm is high. Therefore, the algorithm can be implemented in a smart home equipped with an energy storage system, renewable energy source, and various types of appliances such as inflexible, time-flexible, and power-flexible ones.

In the Bitcoin blockchain, efficient block propagation approach can reduce the computing power and the risk of forks. Meanwhile, larger blocks help to improve the throughput of transactions. Thus, the block propagation is a major issue of the scalability of the Bitcoin network. This paper introduces a method to reduce the required bandwidth of block propagation with erasure coding. To begin with, the network nodes are classified into several clusters. When a node wants to propagate a block, the node does not need to propagate the whole information of the block. Instead, the node can only transmit the transaction IDs and the coded information to each cluster. The simulation shows that the proposed method can significantly ease the network traffic among these clusters."

In this work, we shed light on deep learning-based familial analysis by studying different features of Android malware and how effectively they can represent their (malicious) behaviors. We focus on string features of Android malware, namely the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) of all functions extracted from each malware, which faithfully represent all string features of Android malware. We thoroughly study how different string features, such as how security-sensitive APIs are used in malware, affect the performance of our deep learning-based familial analysis model. A convolutional neural network was trained and tested in various configurations on 28,179 real-world malware dataset appeared in the wild from 2018 to 2020, where each malware has one or more labels assigned based on their behaviors. Our evaluation reveals how different features contribute to the performance of familial analysis. Notably, with all features combined, we were able to produce up to an accuracy of 98% and a micro F1-score of 0.82, a result on par with the state-of-the-art."

Maintaining temporal consistency of real-time data while reducing energy cost is of critical importance when designing such IoT systems. In this paper, we formulate the energy-aware real-time data processing problem on multicore platforms and prove it to be NP-hard. In view of the intractability of the problem, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy. We first propose a per-CPU solution, which can result in significant power savings. Next, in order to save energy in a fine-grained granularity, we propose an efficient per-Task solution by adopting the per-CPU solution as a building block. Finally, by developing new energy-aware mapping techniques, we further explore energy savings on multicore platforms. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed methods offer remarkable performance improvement in terms of energy savings, as compared to the state-of-the-art schemes."

A unique method for this structure to generate pseudo-exponential function is analyzed in detail. Therefore, an accurate dB-linear characteristic is realized in this VGA without any exponential generator circuits. The linear control voltage is applied directly to the gate of the transistor and this simple control method exhibits good robustness to process and temperature variation. Measurement results show that the voltage gain varies from −28 dB to 27 dB continuously with more than 4.3 GHz bandwidth and a dB-linear range of 32 dB with less than ±0.6 dB gain error.

On account of this problem, a combined temperature single particle model is developed for 18650 cells in this paper. The proposed model consists of two sub-models, an electrochemical model and a thermal model, which are coupled together in an iterative manner through physicochemical temperature dependent parameters. The electrochemical sub-model mainly simplifies the calculation of lithium-ion concentration in electrode, while an expression for battery temperature distribution is employed in the thermal sub-model. In addition, genetic algorithm is adopted to estimate model parameters by exciting the battery under different operation conditions. This proposed model can provide accurate predictions of terminal voltage and surface temperature at various operating conditions and the proper simplification of mathematical structure making it ideal for real-time battery management system application.

Rabie']",0,"DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) has been proposed in visible light communication (VLC) to overcome the limited modulation bandwidth of light emitting diode (LED). Due to the implementation of the inverse fast Fourier transform at the DCO-OFDM transmitter, DCO-OFDM suffers from its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which restricts its use in some VLC applications, especially where the optical power efficiency is a crucial requirement. That is because the LEDs used in VLC systems have a limited optical power-current linear range. To this end, a novel discrete Fourier transform spread-optical pulse amplitude modulation (DFTS-OPAM) signal scheme based on the single carrier-interleaved frequency division multiple access (SC-IFDMA) signal is introduced in this paper to address the high PAPR issue of OFDM. DFTS-OPAM is achieved by considering a PAM as an SC-IFDMA data symbol and duplicate the output vector of the fast Fourier transform at the SC-IFDMA transmitter side. Simulation results show that the PAPR of the proposed scheme is 7 dB lower than that of DCO-OFDM. Furthermore, this significant PAPR improvement is experimentally investigated where the practical results show that the proposed scheme can provide more 2.5 dB reduction in the average transmitted power requirement compared to DCO-OFDM and can subsequently increase the maximum achieved distance between the transmitter and the receiver up to 44%."

Continual learning (CL) is a branch of ML with the aim of learning a set of knowledge sequentially and continuously from a data stream. On the other hand, differential privacy (DP) has been extensively used to enhance the privacy of deep learning (DL) models. However, the task of adding DP to CL would be challenging, because on one hand the DP intrinsically adds some noise that reduce the utility, on the other hand the endless learning procedure of CL is a serious obstacle, resulting in the catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previous samples of ongoing stream. To be able to add DP to CL, we have proposed a methodology by which we cannot only strike a tradeoff between privacy and utility, but also mitigate the CF. The proposed solution presents a set of key features: (1) it guarantees theoretical privacy bounds via enforcing the DP principle; (2) we further incorporate a robust procedure into the proposed DP-CL scheme to hinder the CF; and (3) most importantly, it achieves practical continuous training for a CL process without running out of the available privacy budget. Through extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets and analyses, we validate the efficacy of the proposed solution."

As the grades obtained from peer grading are not as accurate as those provided by the instructors, many methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of peer grading. However, the current methods mainly focus on the scenario of online teaching, and they lose effectiveness in blended teaching courses because the mandatory of task and affinity among students may make the students perform irresponsibly in the grading task. This paper proposes a method based on graph analysis to improve the accuracy of peer grading. The peer grading system is modeled as a bipartite graph. In the graph, three interdependent metrics are defined to measure the dutifulness of the grader, the reliability of the rating and the true score of the submission. The stable values of the metrics are computed in an iterative way to obtain the peer grading results. Experiments demonstrate the proposed method is effective in blended teaching settings, and outperforms the current methods.

Specifically, we propose a Pixel-wise Attention Module (PAM) to select low-level features adaptively and a Dual Channel-wise Attention Fusion Module (DCAFM) to fuse the context information further. These two modules use the attention mechanism from a more macro perspective, which is not limited to the inter-layer feature adjustments.

Tunneling and Underground Space Technology, Safety Science, Atmospheric Environment, Lancet and Transportation Research Record are the core journals in the field. At present, the basic theory and research system of URT safety have been basically completed, but the research directions are too concentrated, and the frontier branches are too few. The research themes of URT safety were roughly grouped into three core paths: the “health risk” path, the “risk analysis - safety management” path and the “tunnel displacement/deformation” path.

92,92,Fault Diagnosis of a Propeller Using Sub-Nyquist Sampling and Compressed Sensing,/document/9707757/,2022,['Yuki Kato'],0,"The fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is generally performed using methods that employ vibration and sound. These methods are simple and accurate. However, all of these methods measure vibration data on the basis of the sampling theorem. Thus, they require a high measurement frequency, resulting in a large data volume and expensive measurement equipment. In recent years, a method that uses compressed sensing has been proposed to solve this problem, but it requires dedicated hardware to realize random sampling. To overcome this drawback, we developed a random start uniform sampling method (RSUSM) and combined it with compressed sensing (CS). RSUSM is a method of measuring data at a fixed frequency with a random start time. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the specific constant changes for each RSUSM parameter. This allows us to know the limit of how many measurement points are required for the number of non-zero components. We also applied CS by RSUSM to the sound pressure measurement results of the failed propeller, and found that the signal could be recovered less than 25% error even in a noisy real environment within the aforementioned limit. In this case, we found that the measurement frequency could be compressed to 1/80th of the frequency required by the sampling theorem, and the measurement data size to 1%. This approach is expected to diagnose faults in more rotating machines by significantly reducing the costs associated with data collection and storage."

The ATC rule’s performance is dependent on the lookahead parameter of an equation that calculates the job priority index. Existing studies recommend a fixed value or a value derived through a handcrafted function as an estimate of the lookahead parameter. However, such parameter estimation inevitably entails information loss from using summarized job data and generates an inferior schedule. This study proposes a reinforcement learning-based ATC dispatching rule that estimates the lookahead parameter directly from raw job data (processing time, weight, and slack time). The scheduling agent learns the relationship between raw job data and the continuous lookahead parameter while interacting with the scheduling environment using a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. We trained the DDPG model to minimize the TWT through a simulation in a single-machine scheduling problem with unequal job arrival times. Based on a preliminary experiment, we verified that the proposed dispatching rule, ATC-DDPG, successfully performed intelligent state-dependent parameter tuning. ATC-DDPG also displayed the best performance in the main experiment, which compared the performance with five existing dispatching rules."

Information hiding is an effective manner to hide the transmission behavior of secret information such as keys, and thus it makes the secure key distribution possible. However, the traditional information hiding systems usually embed the secret information by modifying the carrier, which inevitably leaves modification traces on the carrier. Thus, they cannot resist the detection of the steganalysis algorithm effectively. To avoid this issue, the coverless information hiding technique has been proposed accordingly, in which the original images of which features can express the secret information are directly used as stego-images. Since the existing coverless information hiding methods use the low-level handcrafted image features to express secret information, it is hard for them to realize desirable robustness against common image attacks. Moreover, their hiding capacity is limited. To conquer these problems, we design a novel robust image coverless information hiding system using Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster-RCNN). We employ Faster-RCNN to detect and locate objects in images and utilize the labels of these objects to express secret information. Since the original images without any modification are used as stego-images, the proposed method can effectively resist steganalysis and will not cause attackers' suspicion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has higher performance in terms of robustness and capacity compared to the typical coverless information hiding methods."

One approach for achieving this is to establish federations supported by Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), as this enables interoperability between entities and collaboration between business platforms, thereby overcoming many technical and administrative difficulties. DLTs can provide the required transparency and immutability for management of the federations, thus increasing trust and reducing the risk of misbehaviour that could destabilise the federation. This paper presents two system dynamics simulation models, which demonstrate that the success of a federation (with or without DLT support) is inversely related to the short-term selfishness of its members, and we then proceed to show that DLTs can improve the feedback received by the federation members on their actions by promoting a common consensus, which in turn can make the federation more resilient."
102,102,Multivariate Nonlinear Sparse Mode Decomposition and Its Application in Gear Fault Diagnosis,/document/9612194/,2021,"['Haiyang Pan', 'Wanwan Jiang', 'Qingyun Liu', 'Jinde Zheng']",0,"Multi-channel signal has more abundant and accurate state characteristic information than single channel signal. How to separate fault characteristic information from the multi-channel signal is the key of fault diagnosis. As two typical multi-channel signal decomposition methods, multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) are widely used in multi-channel signal analysis. However, MEMD and MVMD use cyclic iteration to complete the analysis of multi-channel signals, and it is difficult to overcome their inherent defects. In view of this, based on nonlinear sparse mode decomposition (NSMD), this paper proposes a multivariate nonlinear sparse mode decomposition (MNSMD) by constraining singular local linear operators to separate the natural oscillation modes in multi-channel signal. By constraining singular local linear operators into signal decomposition, MNSMD has obvious advantages in restraining mode aliasing and robustness. In addition, the local narrow-band component is used as the basis function for iteration, and the component signal is obtained by approaching the original signal. Through the simulation signal and gear fault signal analysis, the results show that, compared with MEMD and MVMD methods, MNSMD method can effectively complete gear fault diagnosis."

We endeavor to build a precise and robust framework for distinguishing diverted drivers. The existing work of distracted driver detection is concerned with a limited set of distractions (mainly cell phone usage). This paper uses the first publicly accessible dataset that is the state farm distracted driver detection dataset, which contains eight classes: calling, texting, everyday driving, operating on radio, inactiveness, talking to a passenger, looking behind, and drinking performed by 26 subjects to prepare our proposed model. The transfer values of the pertained model EfficientNet are used, as it is the backbone of EfficientDet. In contrast, the EfficientDet model detects the objects involved in these distracting activities and the region of interest of the body parts from the images to make predictions strong and accomplish state-of-art results. Also, in the Efficientdet model, we implement five variants: Efficientdet (D0-D4) for detection purposes and compared the best Efficientdet version with Faster R-CNN and Yolo-V3. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms earlier methods in the literature and conclude that EfficientDet-D3 is the best model for detecting distracted drivers as it achieves Mean Average Precision (MAP) of 99.16% with parameter setting: learning rate of

It is becoming obvious that in the development of fifth-generation (5G) and future communication technology, indoor localization technology will play a key role in location-based application scenarios including smart home systems, manufacturing automation, health care, and robotics. Compared with wireless coverage using conventional monopole antenna, leaky coaxial cables (LCX) can generate a uniform and stable wireless coverage over a long-narrow linear-cell or irregular environment such as railway station and underground shopping-mall, especially for some manufacturing factories with wireless zone areas from a large number of mental machines. This paper presents a localization method using multiple leaky coaxial cables (LCX) for an indoor multipath-rich environment. Different from conventional localization methods based on time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA), we consider improving the localization accuracy by machine learning RSSI from LCX. We will present a probabilistic neural network (PNN) approach by utilizing RSSI from LCX. The proposal is aimed at the two-dimensional (2-D) localization in a trajectory. In addition, we also compared the performance of the RSSI-based PNN (RSSI-PNN) method and conventional TDOA method over the same environment. The results show the RSSI-PNN method is promising and more than 90% of the localization errors in the RSSI-PNN method are within 1 m. Compared with the conventional TDOA method, the RSSI-PNN method has better localization performance especially in the middle area of the wireless coverage of LCXs in the indoor environment."

The state space of a Petri net model can be divided into two disjoint parts: a live-zone and a dead-zone. Reachability graph analysis plays an important role in the modeling and control of Petri nets. Most existing studies have to fully enumerate the reachable markings of a Petri net to obtain the first-met bad markings (FBMs), which exacerbates the computational overheads. In this paper, a computationally efficient method to find dead markings in Petri nets is presented. We first introduce an algorithm to find dead markings by solving an integer linear programming problem. Then, the set of markings in the dead-zone is calculated, including the set of dead markings and the set of bad markings. Then we can find all the FBMs. By using a vector covering approach, the minimal covered set of FBMs is computed. The proposed approach can obtain the dead markings and FBMs by searching only a part of a reachability graph. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed method."

Compared with the object detection of natural scenes, remote sensing object detection has some challenges such as scale diversity, arbitrary directions and densely packed objects. To resolve these problems, this paper presents a scale-aware rotated object detection. Firstly, we propose a novel feature fusion module, which takes full advantage of high-level semantic information and low-level high resolution feature. The new feature maps are more suitable for detecting objects with a large difference in scale. Meanwhile, we design a specific weighted loss, which contains an intersection-over-union (IoU) loss and a smooth L1 loss to further address the scale diversity. Besides, in order to detect oriented and densely packed objects more accurately, we propose a normalization strategy for the representation of rotating bounding box. Our method is evaluated on two public aerial datasets DOTA and HRSC2016, and achieves competitive performances. On DOTA, we boost the mean Average Precision (mAP) to 72.95% on oriented object detection."

For optimal operation of the wind farms and stability of the grid, wind prediction ahead of time is of key importance. An accurate forecast of wind speed is often difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the wind. In this work, we utilized different machine learning models and proposed a hybrid machine learning approach. This approach combines 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) network for accurate prediction of short term wind prediction at different heights above ground level (AGL). The 1D CNN model extracts high-level features of the input wind speed data. The extracted features are then fed as input to the BLSTM network for wind speed prediction. The wind speed time series data used in this study are measured at 18, and 98 meters AGL. The study further presents a relationship between the utilized models and prediction accuracy at different heights. The forecasting performance of the models tends to increase as the height AGL increases. A real-world case study is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-BLSTM method in Saudi Arabia. The mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as performance indices to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN-BLTSM model.

A supervised machine learning method based on temporally embedded canonical correlation analysis (tCCA) was utilized to obtain the association between neural activity and local changes in hemoglobin concentrations to enhance localization and accuracy. The results showed deactivation in alpha power rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as declined activation pattern of the fused data in the right PFC at the non-ergonomic workstation. Additionally, all participants at the non-ergonomic workstation experienced a substantial rise in salivary alpha-amylase activity in comparison with the ergonomic workstation, indicating the existence of high-stress levels.

Clustering is an unsupervised data analysis technique used for identifying homogeneous groups of objects based on the values of their attributes. To mitigate the aforementioned drawbacks, an improved firefly algorithm is hybridized with the well-known particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve automatic data clustering problems. To investigate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, it is compared with four popular metaheuristic methods from literature using twelve standard datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the two moons dataset.

The proposed loss functions belong to a family of exponential functions that makes the optimization problems more straightforward to solve, provides analytical properties of the trained classifier, and allows for the simple modification of the loss function such that the naive Bayes classifier becomes robust to noisy instances. This research begins with a typical exponential loss which is sensitive to noise and provides a series of its modifications to make naive Bayes classifiers more robust to noisy instances.

In this paper, a newly developed iterative method is presented in detail for high-accuracy characteristic extraction of multiple frequencies periodic vibration signals based on FFT and least square method. In the situation where the attenuation signal is superposed onto the periodic signal, the accurate characteristics of these two signals are also obtainable. Besides, simulation examples are provided, showing that the proposed method can be applied to the single-frequency signal, multiple frequency signals (including the signals of which the adjacent frequencies are close), and attenuation signal.

However, enabling LSA-based system operational applications is a vital step toward the successful transition to modern distribution systems (MDSs). Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive overview on the state of the art in LSA for MDSs. First, the theoretical formulations of existing LSA methods are summarized. Then, the applications of LSA in distribution systems are highlighted. Finally, based on the analysis of literature, open research gaps and future research pathways are discussed."

However, the prediction accuracy is degraded significantly when the trained network is transferred from the training dataset to real scenarios. To solve this issue, we propose MonoMeMa, a novel deep architecture based on the human monocular cue, which means humans can perceive depth information with one eye through the relative size of objects, light and shadow, etc. based on previous visual experience. Our method simulates the process of the formation and utilization of human monocular visual memory, including three steps: Firstly, MonoMeMa perceives and extracts real-world objects feature vectors (encoding). Then, it maintains and replaces the extracted feature vector over time (storing). Finally, MonoMeMa combines query objects feature vectors and memory to inference depth information (retrieving). According to the simulation results, our model shows the state-of-the-art results on the KITTI driving dataset. Moreover, MonoMema exhibits remarkable generalization performance when our model is migrated to other driving datasets without any finetune."

Current spacecraft anomaly detection systems require costly knowledge and human expertise to identify a true anomaly. Moreover, some new problems and challenges such as large volume of test data, imbalanced data distribution and the scarcity of faulty labeled samples have emerged. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm combining Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Extreme Value Theory (EVT). First, we develop a two-layer ensemble learning based predictor framework which stacks three GRU-based networks with different architectures to learn and capture the normal behavior of multiple channels of data. Then, the prediction errors are calculated and smoothed using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) algorithm. Next, we propose a detection rule setting anomaly threshold automatically through EVT which does not assume any parent distribution on the prediction errors. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt that stacked GRU-based predictors with EVT has been employed into the spacecraft anomaly detection. Through extensive experiments conducted on public datasets as well as real data sampled from a launch vehicle, we show that the proposed detection algorithm is superior to other state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches in terms of model performance and robustness."

This paper focuses on the problem of satellite formation fault diagnosis and prognosis in the literature. Multi-satellite networks that cooperate as multi-agent systems are primarily used to implement cutting-edge technologies and improve future Earth and space observing missions. Space systems constantly encounter numerous failures due to the hazards and challenges of the space environment that need to be tackled.

The application scenario under investigation assumes an environment of static objects, each one associated to a holographic content. The goal is to devise practical low-overhead methods so as to reduce the amount of resources above that are needed for the most resource-demanding AR process, namely object recognition. The proposed method is based on caching images using a combination of metrics to rank them such as: (i) an object popularity index which favours objects that are most probable to be requested for recognition, (ii) the percentage of times when the object label has been encountered in the past, (iii) the probability that an image is similar enough with already encountered past images with the same label. The aforementioned image caching method drastically reduces database searches and returns the matched object that satisfies the needs of object recognition. We also devise a binary decision operator that initiates the object recognition process only upon comparison of spatial data of the AR device with the targeted object. The resulting performance is measured using a client-server architecture and components such as Wireshark, Unity Profiler, and Python. For our proposed architecture we deploy an edge server to satisfy the demands of the AR service. Results indicate that the proposed methods can significantly reduce both the computational resources and the induced network traffic, thus improving user experience."

Real-time states monitoring and data processing of IoT nodes are of great significance, but the processing power of IoT devices is limited. Using the emerging mobile edge computing (MEC), IoT devices can offload computing tasks to an MEC server associated with small or macro base stations. Moreover, the use of renewable energy harvesting capabilities in base stations or IoT nodes may reduce energy consumption. As wireless channel conditions vary with time and the arrival rates of renewable energy, computing tasks are stochastic, and data offloading and renewable energy aware for IoT devices under a dynamic and unknown environment are major challenges. In this work, we design a data offloading and renewable energy aware model considering an MEC server performing multiple stochastic computing tasks and involving time-varied wireless channels. To optimize data transmission delay, energy consumption, and bandwidth allocation jointly, and to avoid the curse of dimensionality caused by the complexity of the action space, we propose a joint optimization method for data offloading, renewable energy aware, and bandwidth allocation for IoT devices based on deep reinforcement learning (JODRBRL), which can handle the continuous action space. JODRBRL can minimize the total system cost(including data buffer delay cost, energy consumption cost, and bandwidth cost) and obtain an efficient solution by adaptively learning from the dynamic IoT environment. The numerical results demonstrate that JODRBRL can effectively learn the optimal policy, which outperforms Dueling DQN, Double DQN (DDQN), and greedy policy in stochastic environments."

For this purpose, an improved Stacking model is designed. Compared with individual estimation models, the improved Stacking model can achieve better concentration estimation performance. That model has a three-layer structure. The first layer is made up of multiple estimation models, which produce intermediate estimation results from the original exhaust data based on the KK -fold cross-validation. The second layer takes these intermediate estimation results as input and trains a statistical learning model which generates preliminary estimation results of the concerned exhaust concentrations. The first two layers actually constitute the Stacking model, which is extended by the additional third layer of our improved one. The third layer implements a weighted summation method. More specifically, the preliminary estimation results generated by the second layer are linearly combined with the concentration estimation results of some strong estimation models, such as XGBoost and LightGBM, to produce the final estimation results in the third layer. Our improved Stacking model is verified through experimental data, which were collected by a Urban Road Network Vehicle Emissions Monitoring System and small weather stations in two Chinese cities, including Beijing and Jiaozuo. Experimental results show that compared with some regression and neural network estimation models, especially the Stacking model and Boosting models, our improved Stacking model achieves higher exhaust concentration estimation accuracy."

SAR-optical image matching can be simplified to single-mode image matching through image synthesis. However, the existing SAR-optical image synthesis methods are unable to provide qualified images for SAR-optical image matching. In this work, we present a K-means Clustering Guide Generative Adversarial Networks (KCG-GAN) to improve the image quality of synthesizing by constraining spatial information synthesis. KCG-GAN uses k-means segmentations as one of the image generator's inputs and introduces feature matching loss, segmentation loss, and L1 loss to the objective function. Meanwhile, to provide repeatable k-means segmentations, we develop a straightforward 1D k-means algorithm. We compare KCG-GAN with a leading image synthesis method-pix2pixHD. Qualitative results illustrate that KCG-GAN preserves more spatial structures than pix2pixHD. Quantitative results show that, compared with pix2pixHD, images synthesized by KCG-GAN are more similar to original optical images, and SAR-optical image matching based on KCG-GAN obtains at most 3.15 times more qualified matchings. Robustness tests demonstrate that SAR-optical image matching based on KCG-GAN is robust to rotation and scale changing. We also test three SIFT-like algorithms on matching original SAR-optical image pairs and matching KCG-GAN synthesized optical-optical image pairs. Experimental results show that our KCG-GAN significantly improves the performances of the three algorithms on SAR-optical image matching."

Herein, we spatially identified thermoelectric plants in different Brazilian regions and states, and measured the state concentrations (levels 1 and 2 of forest) using various indicators, including the concentration ratio (CR(k)), the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI), Theil's entropy (E), and the Gini coefficient (G). Meanwhile, each state's conglomerates were evaluated using the Scan statistic. We found that there are 98 forest-base thermoelectric plants in Brazil, most of which are located in the south-central portion of the country where there is rapid forest growth. The southern region contains 32.65% of the identified plants as a result of the presence of level 2 forest resources (black liquor and forest waste). Regarding the state's concentration (forest level 1), CR(k) revealed a moderate concentration, the HHI and E indices demonstrated low concentrations, and G suggested null to weak inequality. Of these Brazilian forest bioelectricity plants (level 1), 4 clusters were identified, but only one was statistically significant, located in the southern region. Concerning level 2 sources, the only statistically significant conglomerate regarding charcoal was centered in Açailândia (Maranhão). These findings will provide information to assist industry decision-making processes and help guide public policies for forest bioelectricity development in Brazil that favor energy security and improve resource utilization."

Smart cells, incorporating sensors (e.g. temperature, voltage, and current) offer manufacturers a means to develop longer lasting packs, enabling faster charging and extending range. In this work, instrumented cells (cylindrical, 21700) have been developed. Our novel data logging solution (using power line communication, PLC) permits a comprehensive range of sensors to be installed on each cell. Utilizing the cell bus bars, this reduces the necessary wiring harness size and complexity to instrument packs, which can enable higher density energy storage per volume and weight within the vehicle. In this initial feasibility study, a module (4S2P cells) was tested using two diverse cycles (stepped current, 200 mins ×10 cycles, and transient drive, 50 min) in a laboratory climate chamber. The interface system enables research-prototype or traditional sensors to be connected via the PLC network. Miniature sensors (6 temperature, 1 current, 1 voltage) were installed externally on each cell. Excellent performance was observed from the communication system; maximum 0.003% bit error rate, 50ms message receive time (compared to dedicated wired link). Variation in the measured parameters (originally identical cells, temperature 1.0 °C, voltage 5% state-of-charge, current ~ 10%) support the need for improved cell instrumentation to understand cell manufacturing tolerances and aging. This work shows a proof-of-concept study using PLC with instrumented cells, and leads to future work to further reduce the cost and physical size of smart cells."

In the ensemble DE variant, some promising parameters and mutation strategies constitute the candidate pool, and each element in the pool coexists throughout the search process and competes to generate new solutions. The two-level epsilon method is proposed by incorporating a generation and a population comparison level to retain more promising solutions without degrading the solution quality. Moreover, a diversity promotion scheme is developed to improve the population distribution when the search becomes trapped in a small region. The superior performance of CETDE is validated by comparison with some state-of-the-art COEAs over two sets of artificial benchmarks and five real-world problems. The competitive results show that CETDE is an effective method for solving COPs."

To reduce communications and decentralise the processing, IR images should be fully computed on the edge by an Automated Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm, tracking and identifying targets of interest. As edge nodes are constrained in energy and computing capacity, this work proposes two ATR systems to be executed in low-power microprocessors. Both proposals are based on using Bag-of-Features for feature extraction and a supervised algorithm for classification, both differing in segmenting the InfraRed image in regions of interest or working directly with the whole image. Both proposals are successfully applied to infer about a dataset generated to this end, getting a trade-off between computing cost and detection capacity.

To amplify the resistive changes from sensing elements with high precision, various offset contributors in the resistive bridge and amplifiers should be minimized. This study proposes a low-noise resistive bridge sensor analog front-end (AFE) using a chopper-stabilized multipath current feedback instrumentation amplifier (CFIA) and an automatic offset cancellation loop. The proposed circuit exploits a multipath chopper-stabilized architecture for obtaining low noise performance and wide bandwidth characteristics. This circuit can minimize the offsets in the bridge and the high frequency and low frequency amplifiers, while achieving high precision resistive signal acquisition. The high frequency path of the multipath amplifier uses the CFIA topology with class-AB output stage. The offset in the high frequency path is stabilized by the low frequency path amplifier with a high gain and low noise chopper amplifier. The up-modulated offset in the low frequency chopper amplifier path is reduced by the AC-coupled ripple reduction loop (RRL). An automatic offset calibration loop (AOCL) circuit was designed to calibrate the offset due to the bridge mismatch. The AOCL reduces the bridge offset using a successive approximation register (SAR)-based binary-search algorithm. The gain of the proposed circuit is adjustable from 15.56 dB to 44.14 dB.

In the ICCA (Iterative Cone Complementary Approach), which is invoked in optimizing the control law parameters, the starting up steps are designed as a variant CCA (Cone Complementary Approach). ICCA designs an outer loop, over CCA, for searching the minimum cost bound, while the variant CCA omits the outer loop by adding the cost bound in CCA objective function. This starting up can reduce the computational burden. The suboptimal dynamic OFRMPC (where CCA is avoided) is discussed, and a previous approach is re-formulated.

To dock a ship, it is necessary to accurately estimate the relative distance between the quay wall and the ship. However, maneuvering large ships near a port is a complicated and difficult procedure. Thus, tugboats push the ship and dock it at the berth under the supervision of a pilot, who receives distance information from a berthing aid system (BAS). The conventional BAS based on laser distance sensors, which is the most widely used approach, is high-priced and limited by the size of the ship. Additionally, if there is an obstacle between the ship and the berth, the distance cannot be measured, since it obscures the laser signal. To address this problem, we develop an AVMS sensor module composed of a low-priced camera, a differential global positioning system (DGPS) receiver, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with an algorithm to estimate the distance between ship and berth. To evaluate the performance of the proposed AVMS, field tests are performed at Ulsan port in Korea, and the results are compared with a conventional BAS. From the field test results, the AVMS provides highly accurate estimates and shows robust performance in poor weather conditions compared to the conventional BAS. The AVMS can measure the distance between ship and berth regardless of the size of the ship, since it has a wide field of view. In addition, it provides the pilot with real-time image information of the ship approaching the berth to obtain safe ship berthing."

To solve this problem, a machine learning-based NIDS (ML-NIDS) that detects anomalies through ML algorithms by analyzing behaviors of protocols. However, the ML-NIDS learns the characteristics of attack traffic based on training data, so it, too, is inevitably vulnerable to attacks that have not been learned, just like pattern-matching machine learning. Therefore, in this study, by analyzing the characteristics of learning using representative features, we show that network intrusion outside the scope of the learned data in the feature space can bypass the ML-NIDS. To prevent this, designing the active session to be classified early, before it goes outside the detection range of the training dataset of the ML-NIDS, can effectively prevent bypassing the ML-NIDS. Various experiments confirmed that the proposed method can detect intrusion sessions early (before sessions terminate) significantly improving the robustness of the existing ML-NIDS. The proposed approach can provide more robust and more accurate classification with the same classification datasets compared to existing approaches, so we expect it will be used as one of feasible solutions to overcome weakness and limitation of existing ML-NIDSs."

The complicated wave signals scattered by damage are accurately processed using a continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) based on the Gabor wavelet. The transducers are arranged on a composite laminate in the form of a network of square detection cells and triangular subcells. The damage location is estimated using the concept of centroid in two-stage detection method. The first stage detection is carried out by exciting a transducer at the center of each detection cell to locate the damaged cell and subcell. The damage localization is improved by exciting an additional transducer at the corner of the damaged subcell during the second stage detection. The damage size is then quantitatively estimated using cubic spline curve (CSC) and elliptical parametric (EP) methods based on the damage edge points. The damage location is estimated in two detection stages for high-accuracy because the damage edge points are calculated with reference to the estimated location of the damage. The arrangement of transducers and signal processing technique remain the same at all the stages of damage detection. Results from previous detection stages contribute to the improvement of damage detection in the subsequent stages. The size of detection cell plays a crucial role in designing the detection stages, and the proposed method can accurately quantify both location and size of the damage in composite laminate."

In order to solve the problem that encrypted images suffer from some attacks in practical application, we utilize a fast and effective CNN denoiser based on the principle of deep learning. The CNN improves the robustness of the algorithm by improving the resolution of the reconstructed images. Besides, CNN has a high performance against blur and occlusion attacks. We introduce the pixel scrambling method to enhance the security level of the encryption by the private key of pixel scrambling operation. The proposed method can not only realize the encryption of a two-dimensional image but also implement three-dimensional image encryption by combining the integral imaging technology. Double random phase encoding in the fractional Fourier domain is selected for experimental verification, and the results show the capability for robustness, noise immunity, and security of the proposed method."
153,153,Study on Energized Mixed-phase Icing of CFCCW and its Effect on AC Corona Onset Voltage,/document/9292920/,2020,"['Bingbing Dong', 'Jiale Song', 'Changsheng Gao', 'Zelin Zhang', 'Yu Gu', 'Nianwen Xiang']",1,"In winters, China witnesses frequent mixed-phase ice disasters, which have a detrimental impact on the secure operation of transmission lines. Most of the studies are focused on the conventional overhead lines, and little attention is paid to the novel carbon fiber composite core wire (CFCCW), which were widely used in recent years. Besides, the influence rule of frequent mixed-phase icing on the corona onset characteristics for CFCCW has not been extensively studied across extant literature. Thus, this article addresses the aforementioned issues by conducting Alternating Current (AC) corona tests for four kinds of CFCCW that would be coated by mixed-phase ice in a low-temperature laboratory. The results showed that the impact of mixed-phase ice on the wire corona onset voltage can be reduced by nearly 50%. With more icing the corona onset voltage would further decrease but at a slower pace. For the wires with a larger diameter, higher corona onset voltage with low distortion in the electric field strength was observed for the same icing time. For the freezing-water conductivity, no significant impact on both the icing morphology and the corona onset voltage was observed. Moreover, the validation for the simulation model was established by comparing the simulation results with the experimental results. These inferences drawn could act as a theoretical reference for transmission lines designing and calculating the wire corona onset voltage in the mixed-phase icing areas."

Due to good coverage properties for populated areas, inclined orbits are gaining popularity among commercial constellations. A scalable routing algorithm with survivability plays a key role in such systems. In this paper, we propose a distributed survivable routing algorithm for mega-constellations with inclined orbits. First, the special topology characteristic of inclined constellations is identified and formalized. Based on the topology characterization, a basic X-Y routing algorithm is presented to determine multiple primary and secondary paths towards each destination utilizing the regularity of the network topology with minimal computation overhead. Then, a failure recovery mechanism which consists of a restricted flooding mechanism and a pre-detour mechanism is proposed to reduce end-to-end delay and signaling overhead in case of link failures. Besides, a partial-record loop avoidance mechanism is proposed to deal with routing loops with minimal overhead. Finally, a vector-based next hop selection mechanism is proposed to facilitate the selection of next hop while incorporating various criteria. The performance of the proposed routing algorithm is evaluated through simulation on the Starlink constellation. Simulation results show that our proposal achieves scalability by reducing signaling overhead and provides better quality of service in terms of end-to-end delay under link failures."

IoT technology essentially facilitates a platform for service automation through connections of heterogeneous objects via the Internet backbone. However, the security issues associated with IoT networks make smart city infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack violates the authorization conditions in smart city infrastructure; whereas replay attack violates the authentication conditions in smart city infrastructure. Both attacks lead to physical disruption to smart city infrastructure, which may even lead to financial loss and/or loss of human lives. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model is developed for detecting replay and DDoS attacks in a real life smart city platform. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is evaluated using real life smart city datasets (environmental, smart river and smart soil), where DDoS and replay attacks were simulated. The proposed model reported high accuracy rates: 98.37% for the environmental dataset, 98.13% for the smart river dataset, and 99.51% for the smart soil dataset.

The structural pattern matching currently in use has its foundation on algebraic data types from functional languages. To better reflect the pointer structures of OO programs, we propose a pattern matching extension to general statically typed OO languages based on object graphs. By this extension, we support patterns having aliasing and circular referencing, that are typically found in pointer structures. With the requirement of only an abstract subtyping preorder on types, our extension is not restricted to a particular hierarchical class model. We give the formal base of the graph model, that is able to handle aliases and cycles in patterns, together with the abstract syntax to construct the object graphs. More complex cases of conjunction and disjunction of multiple patterns are explored with resolution. We present the type checking rules and operational semantics to reason about the soundness by proving the type safety. We also discuss the design decisions, applicability and limitation of our pattern matching extension."

Kärkkäinen', 'Caroline Andersson', 'Juha Tamminen', 'Mikko Nykyri', 'Pertti Silventoinen']",0,"The energy transition and electrification across many industries place increasingly more weight on the reliability of power electronics. A significant fraction of breakdowns in electronic devices result from capacitor failures. Multilayer ceramic capacitors, the most common capacitor type, are especially prone to mechanical damage, for instance, during the assembly of a printed circuit board. Such damage may dramatically shorten the life span of the component, eventually resulting in failure of the entire electronic device. Unfortunately, current electrical production line testing methods are often unable to reveal these types of damage. While recent studies have shown that acoustic measurements can provide information about the structural condition of a capacitor, reliable detection of damage from acoustic signals remains difficult. Although supervised machine learning classifiers have been proposed as a solution, they require a large training data set containing manually inspected damaged and intact capacitor samples. In this work, acoustic identification of damaged capacitors is demonstrated without a manually labeled data set. Accurate and robust classification is achieved by using a one-class support vector machine, a machine learning model trained solely on intact capacitors. Furthermore, a new algorithm for optimizing the classification performance of the model is presented. By the proposed approach, acoustic testing can be generalized to various capacitor sizes, making it a potential tool for production line testing."

The combination of early diagnosis via rapid screening, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine has helped to control the pandemic. The absence of real time response and diagnosis is a crucial technology shortfall and is a key reason why current contact tracing methods are inadequate to control spread. In contrast, current information technology combined with a new generation of near-real time tests offers consumer-engaged smartphone-based “lab-in-a-phone” internet-of-things (IoT) connected devices that provide increased pandemic monitoring. This review brings together key aspects required to create an entire global diagnostic ecosystem.

Available measures to monitor and/or sterilize surfaces, next-generation laboratory and smartphone-based diagnostic approaches can be brought together and networked for instant global monitoring that informs Public Health policy. Cloud-based analysis enabling real-time mapping will enable future pandemic control, drive the suppression and elimination of disease spread, saving millions of lives globally. A new paradigm is introduced – scaled and multiple diagnostics for mapping and spreading of a pandemic rather than traditional accumulation of individual measurements. This can do away with the need for ultra-precise and ultra-accurate analysis by taking mass measurements that can relax tolerances and build resilience through networked analytics and informatics, the basis for novel swarm diagnostics.

Depending on the nature of the time series data, it can be difficult to build an accurate ML model with the proper structure and hyperparameters. In this study, we propose a predictive error compensation wavelet neural network model (PEC-WNN) for improving the prediction accuracy of chaotic and stochastic time series data. In the proposed model, an additional network is used for the prediction of the main network error to compensate the overall prediction error. The main network takes as inputs the time series data through moving frames in multiple-scales. The same structure and hyperparameter sets are applied for quite distinct four types of problems for verification of the robustness and accuracy of the proposed model. Specifically, the Mackey-Glass, Box-Jenkins, and Lorenz Attractor benchmark problems, as well as drought forecasting are used to characterize the performance of the model for chaotic and stochastic data cases. The results show that the PEC-WNN provides significantly more accurate predictions for all compared benchmark problems with respect to conventional machine learning and time series prediction methods without changing any hyperparameter or the structure. In addition, the time and space complexity of the PEC-WNN model is less than all other compared ML methods, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)."

Electromagnetic coupling of rotor and stator in axial-flow RBPs was described with the Maxwell’s equations of the classical electrodynamics given quasi-magnetostatic approximation of electromagnetic field in the simplified model consisting of permanent magnet and conductive loop rotating in free space with one spatial degree of freedom. Additionally, relative field error, created by the neglect of geometric deviations introduced through manufacturing tolerances, was estimated for a typical axial-flow RBP. Upper limit of error introduced by the simplifications was estimated less than 0.2 %, leading to the finite accuracy of the description and clearly determining the influence on the control signal. Based on the presented description and additional engineering considerations, the electric machine of axial-flow RBPs was defined as a three-phase non-salient pole synchronous machine with a permanent magnet rotor. Two key features were shown: a) unlike the conventional electric motors, signal of back electromotive force tends to be a sinusoidal waveform in any construction of axial-flow RBP with significant non-magnetic gap; b) the optimal waveform of control signal in this case is sinusoidal. Initial design and control parameters of the electric machine in axial-flow RBPs can be accurately determined with presented theoretical description.

Moreover, recent researches in computer vision suggest that robust features lead to higher recognition accuracies. Hence, an improved HIR system has been proposed in this paper that combines 2D and 3D features extracted using machine learning and deep learning techniques. These discriminative features result in accurate classification and help avoid misclassification of similar interactions. Ten keyframes have been extracted from each video to reduce computational complexity. Next, these frames have been preprocessed using image normalization and noise removal techniques. The Region Of Interest (ROI), which contains the two humans involved in the interaction, has been extracted using motion detection. Then, the human silhouettes have been segmented using the GrabCut algorithm. Next, the extracted silhouettes have been converted into 3D meshes and their heat kernel signatures (HKS) have been obtained to extract key body points. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to extract full-body features from 2D full-body silhouettes. Then, topological and geometric features have been extracted from the key body points.

However, there still exists a non-standardized metric in which the distance between samples is greater than 1 after features are standardized. It is difficult to find the optimal search path if the data sample metrics are not standardized. To address this problem, we develop a dynamic-metric accelerated method for fuzzy clustering by introducing a metric matrix, whose diagonal elements consist of infinite norms of the metric matrix into the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm and its derived algorithms. More specifically, we focus on constructing a dynamic metric matrix that is used to unify the metric between data samples and updating cluster centers to optimize the search path of the cluster center. In addition, we propose a new evaluation index named the Coefficient of Variation Metric (CVM) to evaluate metric effectiveness. The dynamic metric accelerated method, whose complexity remains unchanged, can effectively accelerate the iteration speed of fuzzy clustering. The comparisons between the algorithm using the dynamic metric accelerated method and the corresponding algorithm on UCI, business district and COVID-19 CT image datasets show the superiority of the dynamic metric accelerated method in accelerating effect and clustering performance."

Chest CT imaging has been widely used in clinical practice for disease diagnosis, but image reading is still a time-consuming work. We aim to integrate an image preprocessing technology for anomaly detection with supervised deep learning for chest CT imaging-based COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, a matrix profile technique was introduced to CT image anomaly detection in two levels. At one-dimensional level, CT images were simply flatted and transformed to a one-dimensional vector so that the matrix profile algorithm could be implemented for them directly. At two-dimensional level,a matrix profile was calculated in a sliding window way for every segment in the image. An anomaly severity score (CT-SS) was calculated, and the difference of the CT-SS between the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images was tested. A sparse anomaly mask was calculated and applied to penalize the pixel values of each image. The anomaly weighted images were then used to train standard DenseNet deep learning models to distinguish the COVID-19 CT from Non-COVID-19 CT images. A VGG19 model was used as a baseline model for comparison. Although extra finetuning needs to be done manually, the one-dimensional matrix profile method could identify the anomalies successfully. Using the two-dimensional matrix profiling method, CT-SS and anomaly weighted image can be successfully generated for each image. The CT-SS significantly differed among the COVID-19 CT images and Non-COVID-19 CT images (p−value<;0.05p-value <; 0.05 ).

It is an arduous task for a human triager to assign an appropriate developer to a bug report, when there are several developers with different skills, and several automated and semi-automated triage systems have been proposed in the last decade. Some recent techniques have suggested possibilities for the development of an effective triage system. However, these techniques require improvement. In previous work, we proposed a heterogeneous graph representation for bug triage, using word–word edges and word-bug document co-occurrences to build a heterogeneous graph of bug data. Cosine similarity is used to weight the word–word edges. Then, a graph convolution network is used to learn a heterogeneous graph representation. This paper extends our previous work by adopting different similarity metrics and correlation metrics for weighting word–word edges. The method was validated using different small and large datasets obtained from large-scale open-source projects. The top-k accuracy metric was used to evaluate the performance of the bug triage system. The experimental results showed that the point-wise mutual information of the proposed model was better than that of other word–word weighting methods, and our method had better accuracy for large datasets than other recent state-of-the-art methods.

175,175,Automated Heart Valve Disorder Detection Based on PDF Modeling of Formant Variation Pattern in PCG Signal,/document/9729771/,2022,"['Monjur Morshed', 'Shaikh Anowarul Fattah', 'Mohammad Saquib']",0,"Heart valve disorder (HVD) analysis from heart sound is being well known for a long period of time, and use of digital stethoscope gives opportunity to diagnose HVDs from phonocardiographic (PCG) signal. An automated HVD detection technique from PCG signal can play a key role as a first-hand diagnostic tool for the physicians. In this paper, in order to classify different HVDs, we propose to utilize the formant characteristic of the PCG signal, which is an acoustic property of the heart sound. PCG signals exhibit significant variations depending on different types of HVDs and thus conventional time frequency domain features or statistical features are extracted from PCG signal for disease classification. However, direct PCG signals are also used in sequential networks to classify HVDs. Similar to the formant peaks of voiced speech signal, the spectrum corresponding to the PCG signal exhibits distinguishable peaks, especially in the voiced part of the heart sound (lub-dub). Keeping this notable key point in consideration, Burg’s autoregressive model is used to find the parametric spectrum of the PCG signal. The first two formants of the PCG signal, that carry the most informative acoustic properties of the heart sound, are estimated from the Burg’s spectrum, and are used for feature extraction. The magnitude, frequency and phase of each formant are considered to evaluate these features. Instead of considering a long duration of PCG signal at a time, we consider the overlapping sub-frames, and extract formants from each sub-frame, which generates a temporal variation of the formants. Finally, we propose a PDF model fitting of the formant variation, and utilize the estimated model parameters along with some statistical features to classify the HVDs. Two famous publicly available PCG datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, that efficiently classify the binary/five classes of heart sounds. The results reveal that the proposed method has t..."

Routing and VNF deployment for VNF service chain (VNF-SC) in Inter-DC EONs is a very important and well-known NP-hard problem. For this problem, if determining the number and locations of data centers is additionally considered, it will be more complicated. In this paper, we investigate a network planning problem in Inter-DC EONs by determining all these factors, i.e, by determining not only the optimal routing and the optimal VNF deployment for VNF-SCs, but also the optimal number and locations of data centers. To achieve this purpose, we first establish a bi-level programming model in which the leader's objective is to minimize the number of data centers and find the best locations of data centers so that we can get a balanced VNF deployment on data centers. To determine the optimal routing and VNF deployment for VNF-SCs, the follower's objective is to minimize the maximum index of used frequency slots and the number of used frequency slots. Then, to solve the proposed model effectively, tailor-made crossover, mutation and local search operators are designed, and based on these operators, an efficient bi-level hybrid memetic algorithm (BiHMA) is proposed. Finally, to test the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, the simulation experiments are conducted on two widely used networks, and experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a higher efficiency than compared algorithms."

The top and bottom layers have the same square patch structure embedded in the bending gap, whereas the middle layer has an interlaced metal grid structure. The medium between each layer is made of flexible polyimide material with a thickness of only about 0.2mm. The coupling of the three metal layers gives rise to a first X-band passband, with a central frequency of 10.6 GHz. The interlaced metal grid structure generates a second K-band passband, with a central frequency of 24.1GHz. The two-layer symmetrical planar cascade structure produces double-peak resonances at 39.4 GHz and 46.2 GHz, forming a third millimeter-wave passband. Compared with the traditional tri-band FSSs, due to the combination of bending technology and multi-screen cascade technology, the reported structure generates the first and second passbands with miniaturization and good angle stability, and the third passband with rectangular filtering characteristics. Besides fabrication and tests, the corresponding equivalent circuit model is also established in order to analyze the transmission characteristics. The test results are well compatible with the simulation results."

Despite different robot systems are studied in the fusion reactor, there is still a lack of research on mechanism development for vacuum vessel assembly, which is attractive to future fusion reactors. In the fusion reactor, the robot systems will carry out different tasks, such as welding and machining. The assembly tasks of the vacuum vessel will be performed from inside of the vacuum vessel on-site. Then the paper introduces the single-objective and multi-objective optimization design of the proposed mechanism, the optimized objective is considered to be a combination of parallel mechanism dynamic machining force, dexterity, stiffness, and workspace volume. The design variables are derived from the geometry of the fixed and movable platforms, which include mass, inertia, the sizes of the platforms, and distances between universal joints located on the platforms. In the multi-objective optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is adopted and different trajectories are designed to simulate the machining process, which further turns the local optimization problem into a global optimization problem. Finally, the optimized results are extracted and analyzed. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective optimization approaches and multi-objective optimization is found to be more reliable than single-objective optimization."

The main advantage of this approach is the simplicity and the resulting low cost, which makes it suitable for future application in battery management systems. In detail, the excitation of the piezo actuator is done using a single semiconductor switch instead of a power amplifier, and the received signal is processed with an amplifier and Schmitt-trigger combination to condition the signal for the microprocessor, which is part of a battery management system. Both the functionality and the limits of the design are evaluated with a high energy density Lithium-Ion pouch cell under different operational scenarios. Several parameters such as temperature, current rates, and excitation frequency are varied to prove the design concept.

Prosvirin', 'Jaeyoung Kim', 'Jong-Myon Kim']",6,"This paper proposes a three-stage fault diagnosis strategy for multistage centrifugal pumps. First, the proposed method identifies and selects fault characteristic modes of vibration to overcome the substantial noise produced by other unrelated macro-structural vibrations. In the second stage, raw hybrid statistical features are extracted from the fault characteristic modes of vibration in time, frequency, and the time-frequency domain. These extracted features result in a high-dimensional feature space. However, in general, not all of the features are best to characterize the ongoing processes in a centrifugal pump, and some of the extracted features might be irrelevant or even redundant, which can affect the fault classification capabilities of the classification algorithm. In the third stage, a novel dimensionality reduction technique, called Pearson Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA), is introduced. PLDA assesses the helpfulness of the feature parameters. This technique selects highly interclass-correlated features and adds them to a helpful feature pool. To achieve maximum intraclass separation while maintaining the original class information, linear discriminant analysis is then applied to the helpful feature pool. This combination of helpful feature pool formation and linear discriminant analysis forms the proposed application of PLDA. The reduced discriminant feature set obtained from PLDA is then classified using the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm. The proposed method outperforms the previously presented methods in terms of classification accuracy."

The performance of a CCPP under full load is affected by a variety of factors such as weather, process interactions, and coupling, which makes it challenging to operate. Therefore, a reliable assessment of the maximum output power of a CCPP is required to improve plant reliability and monetary performance. In this paper, a predictive model based on a generalized additive model (GAM) is proposed for the electrical power prediction of a CCPP at full load. In GAM, a boosted tree and gradient boosting algorithm are considered as shape function and learning technique for modeling a non-linear relationship between input and output attributes. Furthermore, predictive models based on linear regression (LR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), decision tree (DT), and bootstrap-aggregated tree (BBT) are also designed for comparison purposes. Results reveal that GAM improves the RMSE by 74%, 68.8%, 70.3%, 54.8%, 21.2%, and 17.3% compared to LR, GPR, MLP, SVR, DT, and BBT, respectively. Furthermore, the results of the Man-Whitney U test and rank analysis also confirm the effectiveness of GAM for energy prediction of CCPP. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed method is effective, robust, and accurate for the assessment of the maximum output power of a CCPP to improve plant consistency and financial performance."

Among several SCA approaches, the correlation power analysis (CPA) is an efficient way to recover the secret key of the specific cryptographic algorithms running on the target devices such as embedded microprocessors. However, the evaluation process is time-consuming since a large number of traces are required to overcome the impact of noise. Hence, this paper proposes new methods to reduce the computation time by using Point of Interest (POI) extractor with the power trace biasing technique and the correlation distribution for the low complexity correlation power analysis (CPA). The theoretical explanations are provided and the experiments on different platforms such as ASCAD and RISC-V processor based databases are conducted to justify the proposed techniques. Especially, our experiments are performed with different protected schemes such as masking, hiding and combined hiding-masking techniques. The experimental results indicate that our proposed methods provide reliable results in comparison with the standard CPA. By using only a half of the power traces for taking the POIs, our first proposal not only decreases the execution time approximately by half but also enhances the success rate of the attack. Moreover, the second method based on power trace biasing technique is proposed in order to achieve better results and reduce the number of traces needed for selecting the POIs. With only 28.9% of given power traces needed, our second proposed technique reduces the execution time to only 2.6 times of the standard CPA."

The PEKS scheme suffers from a major drawback which is keyword guessing attack. A keyword guessing attack (KGA) allows the attacker to successfully guess the correct keyword encrypted in a searchable ciphertext and trapdoor. To overcome this vulnerability, security notions, such as keyword privacy and trapdoor privacy were introduced. Keyword privacy prevents any information leaked from the keyword itself, and similarly trapdoor privacy prevents any information leaked from the trapdoor side. A PEKS scheme that is secure against KGA should satisfy trapdoor privacy. In this paper, we compare various types of PEKS schemes in terms of their underlying computational hardness, system model, search function, security properties of keyword privacy and trapdoor privacy, and security against offline KGA and online KGA. From the comparison analysis, we highlight that trapdoor privacy and keyword privacy are essential for a PEKS scheme to be secure against KGA. Lastly, we draw some potential research directions."

Moreover, this study proposes an approach to update the basic probability assignment (BPA) of DST, which represents the confidence of the prediction, at each iteration during the RUL prediction. The updated BPA at each iteration will increase the importance of the high confidence prediction method in the combined results. Thus, it will provide a more accurate prediction result.

According to the 2019 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-19), the 5G and ESIM systems will operate in adjacent frequency bands bounded by 27.5 GHz; therefore, the adjacent channel compatibility between ESIM and 5G should be verified. Both, the minimum coupling loss (MCL) and Monte-Carlo (MC) methods are applied to assess the worst and most practical interference effects, respectively, for all types of ESIM including the following: maritime ESIM (M-ESIM), land ESIM (L-ESIM), and aeronautical ESIM (A-ESIM). The distance and guard band between the two systems are indicated by the compatibility conditions. In addition to the conventional interference-to-noise ratio (I/N), the throughput loss of a 5G system is proposed to assess the performance degradation caused by the ESIM interference. Two orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms are proposed to suppress ESIM power leakage into an adjacent channel. A mathematical expression regarding the power spectral density (PSD) and frequency dependent rejection (FDR) is derived for these waveforms, suggesting that the interference can be alleviated. A measured single carrier waveform of a commercial ESIM equipment is used as the benchmark against the proposed OFDM waveforms. The windowed OFDM is able to reduce the guard band by 50-77%.

This article proposes a new type of welding WFS and investigates the PV penetrated energy systems. The proposed system comprises of a solar PV generator, a DC/DC buck converter, and a permanent magnet DC (PMDC) motor. The power of the proposed standalone solar photovoltaic-wire feeder system (PV-WFS) can be widely improved using an intelligent fractional-order fuzzy proportional integral derivative (FO-Fuzzy-PID) regulator based on perturbing and observe (P&O) MPPT method. In this article, a FO-Fuzzy-PID regulator is also designed for a PMDC motor driven welding WFS system. Which will then control the wire feed rate of the welding WFS system. Furthermore, the dynamic reaction of the proposed solar PV-WFS depends on the coefficients of these FO-Fuzzy-PID regulators, which are adjusted by a meta-heuristic tuning algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed strategy is tested using MATLAB simulations and experimentally verified in real-time on a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing platform using a dSPACE 1104 board-based laboratory setup. Simulation and experimental results are acceptable and demonstrate the effectiveness, precision, stability, and dynamic reaction of the suggested optimized wire feeder regulating system and the considered intelligent P&O MPPT technique."

It requires handling a high level of nonlinearity and dynamics. Model-free control effectively handles the uncertain nature of the problem, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches are a good candidate for solving this problem. In this article, the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm (TD3), as recent and composite architecture of RL, was explored as a tracking agent for the UAV-based target tracking problem. Several improvements on the original TD3 were also performed. First, the proportional-differential controller was used to boost the exploration of the TD3 in training. Second, a novel reward formulation for the UAV-based target tracking enabled a careful combination of the various dynamic variables in the reward functions. This was accomplished by incorporating two exponential functions to limit the effect of velocity and acceleration to prevent the deformation in the policy function approximation. In addition, the concept of multistage training based on the dynamic variables was proposed as an opposing concept to one-stage combinatory training. Third, an enhancement of the rewarding function by including piecewise decomposition was used to enable more stable learning behaviour of the policy and move out from the linear reward to the achievement formula. The training was conducted based on fixed target tracking followed by moving target tracking. The flight testing was conducted based on three types of target trajectories: fixed, square, and blinking. The multistage training achieved the best performance with both exponential and achievement rewarding for the fixed trained agent with the fixed and square moving target and for the combined agent with both exponential and achievement rewarding for a fixed trained agent in the case of a blinking target. With respect to the traditional proportional differential controller, the maximum error reductio..."

Our proposal is based on a combination of the actual depth readings of Pepper and a deep learning-based monocular depth estimation. As shown, the combination of both of them provides a better 3D representation of the scene. In previous works we made an initial approximation of this fusion technique, but it had some drawbacks. In this paper we analyze the pros and cons of the Pepper readings, the monocular depth estimation method and our previous fusion method. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed fusion method outperforms them all."

However, remote sensing data can provide spatial-continuous / temporal-disperse crop information while crop growth model can provide temporal-continuous / spatial-disperse crop information. Therefore, the assimilation between crop growth model and remote sensing data is an efficient way for obtaining continuous vegetation growth information. This study aims to present a parallel method based on graphic processing unit (GPU) to improve the efficiency of the assimilation between RS data and crop growth model to estimate rice growth parameters. Remote sensing data, Landsat and HJ-1 images, were collected and the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop growth model which has a strong flexibility was employed. To acquire continuous regional crop parameters, particle swarm optimization (PSO) data assimilation method was used to combine remote sensing images and WOFOST and this process is accompanied by a parallel method based on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform of NVIDIA GPU. With these methods, we obtained daily rice growth parameters of Zhuzhou City, Hunan, China and compared the efficiency and precision of parallel method and non-parallel method. Results showed that the parallel program has a remarkable speedup (reaching 240 times) compared with the non-parallel program with a similar accuracy.

As the number of antennas increases, the system overhead associated with beam management will increase dramatically. To address this overarching problem, a neural network-aided millimeter-wave beamforming algorithm is proposed in this paper. A new parameter, referred to as “beam adjustment interval”, is proposed to evaluate the beamforming performance. It is defined as the maximum time duration in which the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the user equipment can be maintained above the predefined threshold. Besides, a predictive method of beam adjustment to maximize the beam adjustment interval is developed, which considers the SINR not only at the current location but also future possible locations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly increase beam adjustment interval and reduce the total number of beam adjustments for the moving user equipment, thus reducing the system overhead 41.4% on average over 10 randomly generated test traces."

To deal with two issues, we construct a fast and secure public key authenticated searchable encryption scheme with designed server. Our scheme can resist keyword guessing attacks, chosen multi-keyword attacks and multi-trapdoor attacks. The search function in our scheme achieves the logarithmic search time in number of keywords while most existing schemes required the linear time.

However, they often generate many overfitting patches which pass only a specific test-suite but do not fix the bugs correctly. This paper proposes MIPI, a novel approach to reducing the number of overfitting patches generated in the APR. We leverage recent advances in deep learning to exploit the similarity between the patched method’s name (which often encloses the developer’s intention about the code) and the semantic meaning of the method’s body (which represents the actual implemented behavior) for identifying and removing overfitting patches generated by APR tools. Experiments with a large dataset of patches for QuixBugs and Defects4J programs show the promise of our approach. Specifically, in a total of 1,191 patches generated by 23 existing APR tools, MIPI successfully filters out 254 (32%) of the total 797 overfitting patches with a precision of 90% while preserving 93% of the correct patches. MIPI is more precise and less damaging to the APR than existing heuristic patch assessment techniques, achieving a higher recall than automated testing-based techniques that do not have access to the test oracle. In addition, MIPI is highly complementary to existing automated patch assessment techniques."

The second-generation satellite broadcasting standard (DVB-S2) and its extension (DVB-S2X) adopt a special Irregular Repeated Accumulate (IRA) LDPC code as inner coding scheme. However, due to the large block size, most of the architectures proposed so far use Random Access Memory (RAM) to store and update the encoding results, and the delay caused by address-controlled read and write operations and barrel shift during computation inevitably limits the upper bound of encoder throughput. In this paper, by extracting the periodicity of the parity-check matrix, we introduce a fast encoding algorithm that can efficiently process the multiplication of the information sequence and a large-dimensional sparse matrix, and propose an encoder architecture with low encoding delay and high throughput.

However, the rebound effects may occur during the recovery process of DR, which can limit the operating reserve quality of ACs or even affect the reliable operation of power systems. With the community-level smart energy hubs (EH), the traditional electricity-driven TCLs can be expanded into multi-energy driven thermostatically controlled loads (MTCLs), e.g., household radiators. Under this circumstance, integrated demand response (IDR) can be exploited to coordinate the operation of MTCLs and provide more operating reserve resources while mitigating rebound effects. To this end, this paper proposes a two-stage IDR strategy to fully excavate the operating reserve provided by MTCLs. The first stage is to coordinate the energy consumption of ACs and household radiators to maximize the end-users’ thermal comfort and mitigate the rebound effects. To quantify the end-users’ thermal comfort, a modified predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) index related to thermal environment parameters is introduced and simplified. Based on the energy consumption determined in the first stage, the energy conversion in EH is optimized in the second stage. Through the optimization in these two stages, a series of indices is established to evaluate the operating reserve in terms of aggregate capacity, duration, ramp rate, and smoothness. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed two-stage IDR strategy can provide high-aggregate-capacity and long-duration reserve resources in power systems while mitigating the rebound effects to maintain supply-demand balance and reliable operation of power systems. The analysis results of the test system show that the reserve capacity and duration obtained by the proposed model are 1.85 and 2.61 times those of the model without considering the multi-energy conve..."

However, existing methods seldom consider the diverse quality of data points in different views, and assign each data point with the same importance for clustering. This way degrades the clustering performance due to the interference of low quality data points on the learned clustering indicators. In this paper, a novel robust multi-view clustering method with a unified weight learning paradigm is proposed to address this issue. The unified weight learning paradigm adaptively learns the quality of data points and the clustering capability of each view. Specifically, the reconstruction error of each data point in each view is treated as a factor to depict the quality of data point in this view. Afterwards, the clustering capability of each view is captured from the diverse quality of data points in each view. The clustering capability of each view in turn improves the learning process of data quality. An alternating iterative optimization algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantee and complexity analysis is designed to optimize the objective function. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

Therefore, in this article, we examine an LSTM based temporal spectrum prediction model and characterize its prediction performance through theoretical analysis. To this end, we analyze the LSTM prediction outputs over simulated Markov-model-based spectrum data and spectrum measurements data. Our results suggest that the predicted scores of the LSTM based system model can be described using mixtures of truncated Gaussian distributions. We also estimate the performance metrics using the mixture model and compare the results with the observed prediction performance over simulated and measured datasets."

Parameters such as parking duration, battery state-of-charge (SoC), and charging amount are provided by EVs to the charging coordination center to schedule their charging requests efficiently. The existing literature assumes that the customers always provide correct information. Unfortunately, customers may provide false information to gain higher charging priority. Assessing the impact of cheating behavior represents a significant and open problem. Herein paper, the impact of providing false information (e.g., parking duration) on the efficiency of the charging coordination mechanism is investigated. The charging coordination strategy is formulated as a linear optimization problem. Two different objectives are used to assess the impact of the objective function on the amount of performance degradation. Our investigations reveal that the degradation of the efficiency of the charging coordination mechanism depends on the percentage of cheating customers and cheating duration versus the typical parking duration. In addition, the impact of cheating behavior increases with the number of deployed chargers. Thus, the severity of the cheating impact will increase in the future as more fast chargers are allocated in charging networks."

A new channel model incorporating MLA is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed MLA on beam gain and system throughput gain. The channel model is derived by decomposing the entire propagation channel from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna through metamaterial lens into five serial channels. The measurement results of the MLA prototype prove that the channel model is valid to reflect the actual multiple beam patterns. Simulation results based on the channel model show that a single large-aperture MLA can achieve beam gain of up to 14 dB compared to the case without a lens. Finally, by adopting the proposed large-aperture MLA, it is shown through system-level simulation that the throughput of user equipment is increased on cellular networks."

A new noise-robust edge detection method is proposed, which uses a set of multiscale anisotropic morphological directional derivatives to extract the edge map of an input image. The main advantage of the method is that high edge resolution is maintained while reducing noise interference. The following five parts form the whole framework of this paper. First, multiscale anisotropic morphologic directional derivatives (MSAMDDs) are proposed to filter and obtain the local gray value of the image. Second, the edge strength map (ESM) is extracted by using spatial matching filters. In the third stage, multiscale edge direction maps (EDMs) based on the directional matched filters are fused, and the new EDM is constructed. Fourth, edge contours are obtained by embedding the ESM and the EDM into the standard route of Canny detection.

For applications such as search engines and online stores, Recommender Systems have long become the key tool for assisting users in their choices. Interestingly, the use of Recommender Systems for recommending scientific items remains a rarity. One difficulty is that the development of such systems depends on the availability of adequate datasets of users' feedback. While there are several datasets available with the ratings of the users for books, music, or films, there is a lack of similar datasets for scientific fields, such as Astronomy and Life and Health Sciences. To address this issue, we propose a methodology that explores scientific literature for generating utility matrices of implicit feedback. The proposed methodology consists in identifying a list of items, finding research articles related to them, extracting the authors from each article, and finally creating a dataset where users are unique authors from the collected articles, and the rating values are the number of articles a unique author wrote about an item. Considering that literature is available for every scientific field, the methodology is in principle applicable to Recommender Systems in any scientific field. The methodology, which we call LIBRETTI (LIterature Based RecommEndaTion of scienTific Items), was assessed in two distinct study cases, Astronomy and Chemistry. Several evaluation metrics for the datasets generated with LIBRETTI were compared to those derived from other available datasets using the same set of recommender algorithms.

Therefore, there is a significant need for reinforcement learning approaches to solve them, where the agent perceives the state of the environment partially and noisily. Guided reinforcement learning methods solve this issue by providing additional state knowledge to reinforcement learning algorithms during the learning process, allowing them to solve a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) more effectively. However, these guided approaches are relatively rare in the literature, and most existing approaches are model-based, meaning that they require learning an appropriate model of the environment first. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free approach that combines the soft actor-critic method and supervised learning concept to solve real-world problems, formulating them as POMDPs.

Through application of this extended IPM it is demonstrated, that simultaneous use of gyro-sensor data can minimize the necessary initial adjustment of the motor angle for controlled robot-body rotation, which additionally has the positive effect of reducing possible overshoots of the motor's rotation angle during feedback. Consequently, the reported feedback control improves the robot-body stability on inclined surfaces. Efficient implementation of the developed control scheme into an existing robot's electrical system is proposed."

The aim of this study is to determine the maximum bond strength achievable by this method and to find suitable printing parameters that allow for the production of reliable and consistent solder bumps by non-contact printing of molten solder (type SAC305). Molten solder droplets of about 250 μm diameter were printed at melt temperatures between 250 and 400 °C onto ENIG surfaces kept at temperatures in the range of 100 to 200 °C. Using shear force tests, the adhesion of the printed bumps was investigated as a function of the main process parameters: 1. printhead temperature, 2. substrate temperature, and 3. substrate preheating time. The formation of an intermetallic compound (IMC) between the solder and the ENIG was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements. As a result of the comprehensive experimental parameter study, suitable printing parameters for establishing bond strengths corresponding to maximum shear force values of 3000 to 4000 mN could be found, i.e. high printhead temperature of 400 °C, short preheating and time of <; 2 min, and substrate heating at 180 °C The use of flux was found to slightly improve the bond strength and to improve the consistency of the printing results for extended operation times. The achieved high bond strength and the reasonable reproducibility of the printing results qualify the StarJet technology for further investigations regarding applications in the field of direct soldering of microelectronic chips and devices to PCB boards as well as other micro-assembly tasks in the future."

Classical model predictive control (MPC) has shown effective in building energy management, although it suffers from labour-intensive modelling and complex online control optimization. Recently, with the growing accessibility to building control and automation data, data-driven solutions such as data-driven MPC and reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have attracted more research interest. However, the potential of integrating these two types of methods and how to choose suitable control algorithms have not been well discussed.

Furthermore, the main challenges in these approaches and general discussions on the selection of control methods are discussed."

Compared with an ordinary crowd behavior, the probability of a dangerous crowd behavior is much smaller. Video-based crowd behavior recognition can be categorized as one multi-label classification task, which is characterized by complex scenes and imbalanced samples. Aimed at tackling problems of imbalanced samples and multi-label task, a classification method of associative subspace is proposed. For a single category (called main category) with fewer samples, this paper generates a special subspace wherein it is relatively easy to distinguish these samples by association with other categories. A classifier that can weaken the main category and strengthen relationship between the main category and other categories is designed in the subspace. Therefore, the main category can contribute to reducing dependence on the number of samples with the above-mentioned classifier in the corresponding subspace. In order to make full use of the relevant information concerning categories, multi-label information is further injected into spatio-temporal features of video action representation. Experiments on a challenging WWW dataset show that both the proposed subspace method and multi-label information fusion mechanism are efficient."

Due to the limited healthcare infrastructure and the lack of trained human resources, the CKD problem aggravates if it is not addressed in its earlier stages. In this regard, the role of machine learning-based automated diagnosis systems plays a vital role to deal with the CKD problem. In most of the studies conducted on the automated CKD decision modeling, the main emphasis is given to enhancing the predictive accuracy of the system. In this study, we focus on the applicability challenges of automated decision systems taking CKD diagnosis as a case study within the purview of developing countries. In this regard, we propose a cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking method that takes a more realistic approach to group-based feature selection. Two candidate solutions are proposed for group-based feature selection to meet different objectives. Subsequently, both the candidate solutions are combined into a consolidated solution. It is pertinent to note that it is one of the first studies in which cost-sensitive ensemble feature ranking for non-overlapping groups is successfully demonstrated to achieve the stated objectives i.e. low-cost and high-accuracy solution. Based on an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective and accurate solution for the CKD problem can be obtained. The experimentation includes 7 well-known classification algorithms and 8 comparative feature selection methods to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the applicability of the automated CKD systems can be enhanced by including the cost consideration into the objective space of the solution formulation. Therefore, a trade-off solution can be obtained that is cost-effective and yet accurate enough to serve as a CKD screening system."

233,233,On the Scalability of Vision-Based Drone Swarms in the Presence of Occlusions,/document/9732989/,2022,"['Fabian Schilling', 'Enrica Soria', 'Dario Floreano']",0,"Vision-based drone swarms have recently emerged as a promising alternative to address the fault-tolerance and flexibility limitations of centralized and communication-based aerial collective systems. Although most vision-based control algorithms rely on the detection of neighbors, they usually neglect critical perceptual factors such as visual occlusions and their effect on the scalability of the swarm. To estimate the impact of occlusions on the detection of neighbors, we propose a simple but perceptually realistic visual neighbor selection model that discards obstructed agents. We evaluate the visibility model using a potential-field-based flocking algorithm with up to one thousand agents, showing that occlusions have adverse effects on the inter-agent distances and velocity alignment as the swarm scales up, both in terms of group size and density. In particular, we find that small agent displacements have considerable effects on neighbor visibility and lead to control discontinuities. We show that the destabilizing effects of visibility switches, i.e., agents continuously becoming visible or invisible, can be mitigated if agents select their neighbors from adjacent Voronoi regions. We validate the resulting flocking algorithm using up to one hundred agents with quadcopter dynamics and subject to sensor noise in a high-fidelity physics simulator. The results show that Voronoi-based interactions enable vision-based swarms to remain collision-free, ordered, and cohesive in the presence of occlusions. These results are consistent across group sizes, agent number densities, and relative localization noise. The source code and experimental data are available at

Moving Target Mobile IPv6 Defense II is one of these schemes, in which the node in SCADA system employs the moving target’s mobile IPv6 mechanism to solve the possible security problem the attacker targeting the specific node and launching attacks. However, the node in this novel scheme still should need to send update binding message with its new IP address to other nodes, which still possibly causes IP leakage security problem. Hence, in our study, we propose a moving target defense scheme with Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) based authentication in SCADA system. In our scheme, PUF based authentication scheme ensures the security of the whole IP updating process. Once the nodes finish authentication process, they can perform IP generation mechanism based on unique parameter resulting from PUF outputs. Hence, our proposed scheme can ensure the unique characteristic of our generated IP address and no packet loss in the duration of IP rotation. Compared with other MTD-based schemes, our performance evaluation also shows that our proposed scheme can achieve good security performance in SCADA systems."

A DL network was trained to remove incoherent undersampling artifacts from MR images. The underlying, fully sampled, target image was represented as a discrete quantized image. The quantization step enables the design of a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify each pixel in the input image to a discrete quantized level. The reconstructed image quality of the proposed DL classification model was compared with conventional compressed sensing (CS) and a DL regression model. The reconstructed images using the DL classification model outperformed the state-of-the-art compressed sensing and DL regression models with a similar number of parameters assessed using quantitative measures. The experiments reveal that the proposed deep learning method is robust to noise and is able to reconstruct high-quality images in low SNR scenarios where conventional CS reconstructions and DL regression networks perform poorly. A generic design framework for transforming MR image reconstruction into pixel classification is developed. The proposed method can be easily incorporated into other DL-based image reconstruction methods."

This paper presents a novel ToI-CNN with dual transformer encoders (ToI-CNN + DTE) model for this solution. We design a directional self-attention mechanism to encode contextual representation over the whole-sentence in the forward and backward directions. The features of the entities are extracted from the contextual token representations by a convolutional neural network. Moreover, we use HAT pooling operation to convert the various length ToIs to a fixed length vector and connect with a fully connected network for classification.

In this study, we seek an optimal change propagation path based on complex theories, and by using this approach the cost of the change can be minimized. In particular, we introduce a modified Dijkstra algorithm coupled with a complex network described based on two variables: change probability and change impact. The network depicting the components of a mechanical product and their dependencies is directional while considering both node weights and edge weights. The roles of the components such as change absorbers, carriers, and multipliers are identified.

In this paper, we propose a first general method that enables various basis construction algorithms to overcome the spurious vanishing problem. In particular, we integrate coefficient normalization with polynomial-based basis constructions, which do not need the proper ordering of monomials to process for basis constructions. We further propose a method that takes advantage of the iterative nature of basis construction so that computationally costly operations for coefficient normalization can be circumvented. Moreover, a coefficient truncation method is proposed for further accelerations. From the experiments, it can be shown that the proposed method overcomes the spurious vanishing problem, resulting in shorter feature vectors while sustaining comparable or even lower classification error."

Since there is no declared spectrum allocated to UAV communications, opportunistic transmission has been commonly considered as an important way for supporting UAV communications. When sharing the same spectrum with other users such as satellites and mobile base stations, accurate spectrum sensing and allocation are of critical importance for UAV communications to avoid serious interference. As the UAVs can constantly move to different locations with various spectrum environments, the spectrum decision may be invalid only in a short period, leading to require fast spectrum sensing. Furthermore, an UAV needs to predict possible temporal and spatial vacations of the spectrum. In this case, the spectrum prediction has a high dimensional state space which is notoriously difficult to solve. In this paper, some other issues such as how to determine the spectrum processing time and how to detect the primary signals with high priority to avoid interference, are also discussed. Finally, a fast spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed to improve the energy detection performance by optimizing the error estimation and a constant ratio of missed detection.

The explanation for this behavior is due to the use of monogenic signal geometry, which represents each pixel value in a 3D space using quaternions, a fact that confers a degree of explainability to the networks. The M6 was compared to conventional convolutional layer (C) and a deterministic quaternion local phase layer (Q9). The experimental setup is designed to evaluate the robustness of this M6 enriched ConvNet model and includes three architectures, four datasets, and three types of contrast degradation (including non-uniform haze degradations). The numerical results reveal that the models with M6 are the most robust in front of any kind of contrast variations. This amounts to a significant enhancement of the C models, which usually have reasonably good performance only when the same training and test degradation are used, except for the case of maximum degradation. Moreover, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to analyze and explain the robustness effect of the M6 feature maps under any kind of contrast degradations."
254,254,An Empirical Study Into the Success of Listed Smart Contracts in Ethereum,/document/8919981/,2019,"['Pieter Hartel', 'Ivan Homoliak', 'Daniël Reijsbergen']",4,"Since it takes time and effort to put a new product or service on the market, one would like to predict whether it will be a success. In general this is not possible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximize the chance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is therefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We have investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether successful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart contracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as Etherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we present a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart contracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed contracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts. Next, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an anonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A significant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract itself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention that is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute. Finally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations for developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel of experts."

LoRa technologies, for instance, are used to develop IoT solutions for several smart city domains thanks to its available features, but sometimes people (i.e., citizens, information technology administrators, or city managers) might think that these available features involve cybersecurity risks. This study explores the cybersecurity aspects that define an assessment model of cybersecurity maturity of IoT solutions to develop smart city applications. In that sense, we perform a systematic literature review based on a top-down approach of cybersecurity incident response in IoT ecosystems. Besides, we propose and validate a model based on risk levels to evaluate the IoT cybersecurity maturity in a smart city."

Micro-grids, systems working in islanding mode, are particular cases where some disadvantages are present due to the wide variations which may appear across their electrical quantities. Variations on the voltage amplitude and the frequency are intrinsic in the operation of weak grids, because they have low inertia and therefore the load must be able to cope with these variations, otherwise loads may trip electrical system protection. Particularly, on power electronic drives, these frequency deviations will lead to increased system nonlinearities, entailing a more critical controller design. To overcome these issues, this paper presents an implementation of a resonant controller with self-tuned gains. The strategy imposes a constant sampling time which allows these controllers to be used in variable frequency environments. In addition, the computational capacity required for the digital board is also considered. The simulated and experimental results provided demonstrate the good performance of this proposal."

This paper focuses on the latter definition in order to identify news clickbaits that are published in Twitter. The aim of this work is to use recent Transfer Learning models to detect news clickbaits by adding various configuration changes to the existing models. Based on the author’s knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt Transfer Learning to classify Clickbaits in social media. In this work we fine-tuned BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa models by integrating novel configuration changes into their default architectures such as model expansion, pruning and data augmentation strategies. Webis Clickbait dataset was used to train these models and the best performed model at the Webit Clickbait competition 2017 was considered as our benchmark. The analyses in this work are mainly focused on eight different scenarios after applying several fine-tuning approaches and model configuration changes to the default Transfer Learning models. The results shown that, our modified Transfer Learning approaches outperformed the considered benchmark. In our experiments, the best performed Transfer Learning model was RoBERTa with the integration of an additional non-linear layer with the hidden output tensor. this configuration has achieved 19.12% more accuracy in compared to the benchmark model for the binary classification. There is no significant performance improvement when each model expanded by adding an extra RNN layer(s). Apart from that, we experimented with another labelled clickbait dataset (Kaggle clickbait challenge) to explore the performance of our fine-tuned models under different scenarios."
260,260,An Enhanced Naive Bayes Model for Dissolved Oxygen Forecasting in Shellfish Aquaculture,/document/9279333/,2020,"['Dashe Li', 'Jiajun Sun', 'Huanhai Yang', 'Xueying Wang']",1,"It is difficult to predict dissolved oxygen values because they are disordered and nonlinear. Accurate prediction of dissolved oxygen in shellfish aquaculture plays an important role in improving shellfish production, and a reliable model is needed to accurately predict dissolved oxygen values. Therefore, in this paper, an enhanced naive Bayes (NB) model is proposed. Due to the excessive number of different dissolved oxygen values, their direct use as input samples will result in overly few training set categories for each value, which reduces the prediction accuracy. Therefore, the dissolved oxygen differential series dataset is used as the input data to reduce the number of training set categories and improve the training accuracy. To increase the number of samples in the training set, the sliding window concept from network communication protocols is used to partition the differential sequence dataset and generate the features and labels of the training set. The values were predicted as categories, and the dissolved oxygen data were accurately predicted by selecting the labels that correspond to the posterior probability maxima of all training samples. Finally, the algorithm is used to predict the dissolved oxygen data from February 18, 2016, to January 31, 2020, in Yantai, Shandong Province, China. The dissolved oxygen data of a shellfish farm were trained and predicted, and the best values of the feature lengths were optimized by analyzing their effects on the predicted dissolved oxygen values. The proposed algorithm has significantly improved the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to the advanced algorithms. The results of the Diebold-Mariano test and 10-fold cross-validation also show that the proposed algorithm has a higher prediction accuracy."

The leakage components can be exploited further to improve the linearity of the dosimeter by considering different grading profiles of the AlGaN layer.

The attack traffic flows originating from bots (e.g., compromised IoT devices) are deliberately aggregated at upstream critical links and grow intensified, gradually making a network connected to the critical links disconnected. Although LFAs are far more sophisticated than traditional DDoS attacks, whether such sophistication comes without a downside has never been investigated. In this paper, by modeling link flooding attacks and defenses, we tackle a series of questions concerning the practical issues of LFAs. Specifically, from the perspective of attacks, we advance a novel notion of 
strike precision
, and reveal that LFAs may exhibit 
attack interference
 (i.e., unexpectedly interfere the connectivity of innocent networks) which might undermine the stealthiness and persistence of LFAs. From the perspective of defenses, we make the first step to study 
attack intention

Furthermore, we consider a strong defender who employs traffic engineering to mitigate LFAs, and formulate the game-theoretic interactions between attackers and defenders. The experiment results show that attack interference is pervasive, and our proposed SPAH flooding strategy can substantially lower attack interference and increase strike precision. Moreover, we demonstrate that LFAs can be effectively mitigated based on traffic engineering from a game-theoretic perspective, wherein the defender can adopt non-cooperative measurement techniques to achieve light-weight and multi-protocol-based robust probe deployment."

Nevertheless, network operation has significantly changed due to the rapid integration of renewable energy in supply side. The integration of more renewable resources, especially inverter-based generation, deteriorates power system resilience to disturbances and substantially affects stable operations. The dynamic voltage stability becomes one of the major concerns for the transmission system operators (TSOs) due to the limited capabilities of inverter-based resources (IBRs). A heavily loaded and stressed renewable rich grid is susceptible to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery. Hence, it is crucial to examine the system response upon disturbances, to understand the voltage signature, to determine the optimal location and sizing of grid-connected IBRs. Moreover, the IBRs fault contribution mechanism investigation is essential in adopting additional grid support devices, control coordination, and the selection of appropriate corrective control schemes. This article utilizes a comprehensive assessment framework to assess power systems' dynamic voltage signature with large-scale PV under different realistic operating conditions. Several indices quantifying load bus voltage recovery have been used to explore the system' s steady-state, transient response, and voltage trajectories. The recovery indices help extricate the signature and influence of IBRs. The proposed framework's applicability is carried out on the New England IEEE - 39 bus test system using the DIgSILENT platform."

Impressive progress has been made by adversarial learning-based methods that align distributions across domains through deceiving a domain discriminator network. However, these methods only try to align two domains and neglect the boundaries between classes, which may lead to false alignment and poor generalization performance. In contrast, consistency-enforcing methods exploit the target data posterior distribution to make the target features far away from decision boundaries. Despite their efficacy, these approaches require additional intensity augmentation to align distributions when encountering datasets with large domain discrepancy. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel UDA method that unifies the adversarial learning-based method and consistency-enforcing method together to take both domain alignment and boundaries between classes into consideration. In addition to the supervised classification on the source domain and the adversarial domain adaptation, we introduce interpolation consistency into the UDA task. To be specific, we first construct robust and informative pseudo labels for target samples, and then we encourage the prediction at an interpolation of unlabeled target samples to be consistent with the interpolation of the pseudo labels of these samples. The extensive empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both digit classification and object recognition tasks."

They are implemented using either rule-based or machine learning-based systems. Unlike the former, machine learning-based chatbots are more scalable. Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning is one of the most popular approaches in machine learning-based chatbots and has shown remarkable progress since its introduction in 2014. However, chatbots based on Seq2Seq learning show a weakness in that it tends to generate answers that can be generic and inconsistent with the questions, thereby becoming meaningless and, therefore, may lower the chatbot adoption rate. This weakness can be attributed to three issues: question encoder overfit, answer generation overfit, and language model influence. Several recent methods utilize multitask learning (MTL) to address this weakness. However, the existing MTL models show very little improvement over single-task learning, wherein they still generate generic and inconsistent answers. This paper presents a novel approach to MTL for the Seq2Seq learning model called SEQ2SEQ++, which comprises a multifunctional encoder, an answer decoder, an answer encoder, and a ternary classifier. Additionally, SEQ2SEQ++ utilizes a dynamic tasks loss weight mechanism for MTL loss calculation and a novel attention mechanism called the comprehensive attention mechanism. Experiments on NarrativeQA and SQuAD datasets were conducted to gauge the performance of the proposed model in comparison with two recently proposed models. The experimental results show that SEQ2SEQ++ yields noteworthy improvements over the two models on bilingual evaluation understudy, word error rate, and Distinct-2 metrics."

We propose scanning a predetermined path in an urban locality on the move (OTM) using monitor mode WLAN packet capturing. We also propose that in OTM, devices (STA) and Access Points (APs) can be traced from other packets like CTS, ATS, and ACKs apart from beacons and frames. We performed a case study of monitor mode packet capturing in an on-the-move and outdoor setup. The primary focus of the study was to validate the OTM modality and the methodology of detecting devices and APs. We studied all the packet types that were captured, including Beacons and Probes. The sensed devices and APs counts using probe and beacon packets were compared with the sensed devices, and APs counts using the new methodology. We found that considering other packets helps detect a more significant number of devices and APs. We also found that channel hoping strategy plays an essential role in maximizing the sensed items. The overall exercise revealed that the air is full of WLAN/Wi-Fi traffic, and using OTM can assimilate lots of valuable data and generate relevant information for various purposes. Essentially, on-the-move outdoor capture setups can be used to produce Wi-Fi access points and user devices related heat maps of the scanned locations.

Vehicles in the ITS share basic safety information which can prompt the disclosure of the real identity of the vehicles. Thus, adversaries can misuse these safety messages. Pseudonyms are alias granted to vehicles by trusted authorities to conceal their original identities. To avoid linkability, various pseudonym generation and distribution protocols have been proposed. Such protocols pose overheads in the system as they are performed by Central Authorities. Therefore, re- utilizing the existing pseudonyms through shuffling is the most optimal mechanism for ITS. The Blockchain is a digital ledger and tamper-resistant record of transactions. It eliminates the need for central authority as well as provides anonymity of transactions resulting in more secure and privacy-protected solutions. To handle distribution optimization issues in the pseudonym shuffling process without a central authority, the blockchain is used with its distributed consensus. The shuffling results are logged in blocks as transactions. Pseudonym shuffle randomness is achieved via blockchain and it provides robustness in the structure. When one system fails, the rest would continue to work. The method also provides a fully traceable record in case of certification revocation. The existing blockchain-based pseudonym shuffling mechanism uses traditional consensus algorithms to support the cryptography operation.

The impedance mismatch of a connected/capacitively coupled dipole array is less than that of an array of unconnected dipoles of the same size. Both direct and capacitive connections can be used to design a wideband array antenna with a ground plane, although capacitive coupling performs better than a direct connection. This fact resulted from numerous analytical studies using infinite dipole array scan (active) impedance endorsed by full-wave simulations using CST MWS.

In this paper, a Topic Propagation Prediction method is proposed based on Dynamic Analysis of user-role and topic-influence, named TPP-DA, which predicts the topic propagation on social networks from both users’ and topics’ perspectives. First, we introduce a temporal perspective to improve the static analysis to the dynamic analysis of user-role, which is more adaptable to the changeable user-roles on social networks. Second, we introduce a metric called the topic heat to dynamically analyze the topic-influence on a single user and social group. Third, we combine the dynamic analysis of user-role and topic-influence with a weighted probability model to accurately predict topic propagation trends. The weights are determined by the dynamic analysis of user-role and topic-influence. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate TPP-DA.

The effective management of vehicle routing helps companies reduce operational costs and increases its competitiveness. The vehicle routing problem (VRP) seeks to identify optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to customers while simultaneously considering changing requirements and uncertainties in the transportation environment. Due to its combinatorial nature and complexity, conventional optimization approaches may not be practical to solve VRP. In this paper, a new optimization model based on reinforcement learning (RL) and a complementary tree-based regression method is proposed. In our proposed model, when the RL agent performs vehicle routing optimization, its state and action are fed into the tree-based regression model to assess whether the current route is feasible according to the given environment, and the response received is used by the RL agent to adjust actions for optimizing the vehicle routing task. The procedure repeats iteratively until the maximum iteration is reached, then the optimal vehicle route is returned and can be utilized to assist in decision making. Multiple logistics agency case studies are conducted to demonstrate the application and practicality of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique significantly improves profit gains up to 37.63% for logistics agencies compared with the conventional approaches."
279,279,A Hybrid Approach and Unified Framework for Bibliographic Reference Extraction,/document/9279259/,2020,"['Syed Tahseen Raza Rizvi', 'Andreas Dengel', 'Sheraz Ahmed']",0,"Publications are an integral part of a scientific community. Bibliographic reference extraction from scientific publication is a challenging task due to diversity in referencing styles and document layout. Existing methods perform sufficiently on one dataset however, applying these solutions to a different dataset proves to be challenging. Therefore, a generic solution was anticipated which could overcome the limitations of the previous approaches. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, it presents a novel approach called DeepBiRD which is inspired by human visual perception and exploits layout features to identify individual references in a scientific publication. Second, we release a large dataset for image-based reference detection with 2401 scans containing 38863 references, all manually annotated for individual reference. Third, we present a unified and highly configurable end-to-end automatic bibliographic reference extraction framework called BRExSys which employs DeepBiRD along with state-of-the-art text-based models to detect and visualize references from a bibliographic document. Our proposed approach pre-processes the images in which a hybrid representation is obtained by processing the given image using different computer vision techniques. Then, it performs layout driven reference detection using Mask R-CNN on a given scientific publication. DeepBiRD was evaluated on two different datasets to demonstrate the generalization of this approach. The proposed system achieved an AP50 of 98.56% on our dataset. DeepBiRD significantly outperformed the current state-of-the-art approach on their dataset. Therefore, suggesting that DeepBiRD is significantly superior in performance, generalized, and independent of any domain or referencing style."
280,280,A New Algorithm for Displaying Images With High Resolution Using a Directional Volumetric Display With Threads and a Projector,/document/9701342/,2022,"['Tomoya Imamura', 'Mitsuru Baba', 'Naoto Hoshikawa', 'Hirotaka Nakayama', 'Tomoyoshi Ito', 'Atsushi Shiraki']",0,"Using threads and a projector, a directional volumetric display capable of moving images and full-color representation was developed in our previous work. However, the horizontal resolution of the directional volumetric display could only achieve 20 pixels with 400 threads. Further, the conventional algorithm requires P squared threads per P horizontal pixels of the input image. Because it is difficult to place a large number of threads, thus, a new algorithm for developing projected images to improve the directional volumetric display’s resolution was proposed. It is feasible to display images of P pixels with at least P threads using this technique. However, the higher the resolution, the lower the image quality in the proposed algorithm. Thus, it was verified how many threads can be used to display high-resolution images without degrading the image quality. Further, by representing the horizontal resolution of the input image with 5–6 threads per pixel, it is possible to display high-resolution images while maintaining the image quality. The proposed technique can display 64 pixels per 384 threads, whereas the conventional method can only display 20 pixels input images per 400 threads."
281,281,Tactical Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving Using Dueling Double Deep Q Network With Double Attention,/document/9609990/,2021,"['Shuwei Zhang', 'Yutian Wu', 'Harutoshi Ogai', 'Hiroshi Inujima', 'Shigeyuki Tateno']",0,"Decision-making is still a significant challenge to realize fully autonomous driving. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve autonomous driving decision-making problems is a recent trend. A common method is to encode surrounding vehicles in a grid to describe the state space to help DRL network extract the scene features. However, in the process of human driving, surrounding vehicles at different positions have different contributions to decision-making. Meanwhile, the network is difficult to fully extract useful features in a sparse state, which can also lead to catastrophic actions. Therefore, this work proposes a spatial attention module to calculate different weights to represent different contributions to decision-making results. And a channel attention module is proposed to fully extract useful features in sparse state features. These two attention modules are integrated into dueling double deep Q network, named D3QN-DA, as a high-level decision-maker of a hierarchical hierarchical control structure based decision-making system. To improve agent performance, an emergency safe checker is introduced in this system. And the agent is trained and test with a designed reward function from safety and efficiency in simulation. The experimental results show that the proposed method increases the safety rate by 54%, and the average explore distance by 30%, which is safer and more intelligent for the decision-making process of automatic driving."
282,282,Sparse Graph Learning Under Laplacian-Related Constraints,/document/9606894/,2021,['Jitendra K. Tugnait'],0,"We consider the problem of learning a sparse undirected graph underlying a given set of multivariate data. We focus on graph Laplacian-related constraints on the sparse precision matrix that encodes conditional dependence between the random variables associated with the graph nodes. Under these constraints the off-diagonal elements of the precision matrix are non-positive (total positivity), and the precision matrix may not be full-rank. We investigate modifications to widely used penalized log-likelihood approaches to enforce total positivity but not the Laplacian structure. The graph Laplacian can then be extracted from the off-diagonal precision matrix. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented and analyzed for constrained optimization under Laplacian-related constraints and lasso as well as adaptive lasso penalties. Numerical results based on synthetic data show that the proposed constrained adaptive lasso approach significantly outperforms existing Laplacian-based approaches. We also evaluate our approach on real financial data."

These products shall comply with the same test standard to estimate reliability before being launched into market. Extensive research has been conducted on the optimal design of accelerated life test (ALT) for a single type of product. However, these methods only utilize the information of a certain type of product and hence might not obtain an optimal plan for other products. This motivates us to study the planning of ALT for a manufacturer making multi-series products. Two criteria, i.e., the minimum sum and the minimum maximum of the asymptotic variance (Avar) of the life at a given percentile, are proposed to design the ALT plan optimally. The analytical solutions are derived for some special cases and numerical methods are provided for more general cases. We further explore the difference between test plans obtained by the two criteria in the cases of small and large number of product categories. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The methodology proposed in this paper would be vital for a manufacturer to design its test standard."

We focus on traffic data collection as our target application where vehicles send their locations to a server while driving. Such vehicles are easily trackable-revealing location history-as the application often requires frequent and accurate location updates. This article presents PathCloak, a method that enables vehicles to report their locations while preventing the server from properly tracking the vehicles. PathCloak leverages vehicles' two network interfaces: in-car Internet (for accessing the server) and car-to-car DSRC (for creating path confusion). PathCloak-enabled vehicles exchange their kinematic information via DSRC radios, and use it to generate plausible path segments for each other, making their paths indistinguishable each other from the server's viewpoint. We demonstrate its feasibility via field experiments on real roads using our DSRC testbeds. Our evaluation shows that PathCloak offers strong privacy (tracking success ratio<; 1%), while maintaining high utility for various traffic statistics."
286,286,Robust Fuzzy-Stochastic Programming Model and Meta-Heuristic Algorithms for Dual-Resource Constrained Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem Under Machine Breakdown,/document/9609986/,2021,"['Parham Soofi', 'Mehdi Yazdani', 'Maghsoud Amiri', 'Mohammad Amin Adibi']",0,"Resource scheduling, job sequencing, and assigning them to available resources are the most critical issues in manufacturing systems, such as flexible job-shop systems. In addition, scheduling uncertainties have attracted significant attention in this field. This study investigates the dual-resource constrained flexible job-shop scheduling (DRCFJSS) problem under machine breakdown and operational uncertainty. Stochastic scenario-based methods were utilized to study the uncertain nature of the problem. Because process times have inherent uncertainty, they are considered fuzzy numbers and are controlled by a credibility-based measure. Robust scheduling must be developed to address unexpected disruptions, such as machine breakdowns and operational risks, such as uncertain process times. Accordingly, a novel robust fuzzy stochastic programming (RFSP) model is presented for this problem. In the proposed RFSP model, the objective function is formulated using a hybrid measure (i.e., a combined average-case and worst-case performance of the manufacturing system) under probable machine breakdown scenarios. Because the DRCFJSS problem is NP-hard, two types of meta-heuristic algorithms, evolutionary population-based, genetic algorithm (GA), and vibration damping optimization (VDO) algorithm, are used for large-sized problems. Then, the proposed RFSP model was applied to a case study, and numerical experiments with randomly generated test problems were used. In small-sized problems, the proposed model is solved using the CPLEX solver, GA and VDO algorithms. Also, the computational study confirms the proper quality of the results of the GA and VDO algorithms in medium and large-sized problems."

An assessment of damping control using various MPPT methods for heaving WEC was conducted in this study. Damping control was implemented using a DC–DC boost converter. The duty cycle for MPPT was determined using a perturb and observe algorithm. This assessment study determines the following for applying MPPT for heaving WECs: best location for the observing parameters; best performance index for the MPPT; and effect of averaging the performance index. Three locations for the observing parameters (mechanical parameters near the source, electrical parameters at the load, and electrical parameters between the source and load) and three performance indices (maximising power, minimising impedance, and maximising admittance) were assessed and evaluated. Finally, the effects of applying the running mean and conventional instantaneous value on the performance index were compared. Various scenarios using nine MPPT methods were tested using simulated regular and irregular sea states. The test results were validated experimentally using a simple and low-cost hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) scheme. The HIL scheme was developed using off-the-shelf devices that can be used for any topology of WECs. The results showed that the MPPT method has an optimum performance by using the performance index for maximising power, using observing parameters between the source and the load, and deploying conventional instantaneous values for the observing parameters."

On the other hand, there are lots of documents associated with hierarchical label information. Incorporating these information into the topic modeling process can help users to obtain a more reasonable hierarchical structure. However, after analyzing various real-world datasets, we find that these hierarchical labels are ambiguous and conflicting in some levels, which introduces error and restriction to the latent topic and the hierarchical structure exploration process. We call it the horizontal topic expansion problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical topic model named horizontal and vertical hierarchical topic model (HV-HTM), which aims to incorporate the observed hierarchical label information into the topic generation process, while keeping the flexibility of horizontal and vertical expansion of the hierarchical structure in the modeling process. We conduct experiments on BBC news and Yahoo! Answers datasets and evaluate the effectiveness of HV-HTM on three evaluation metrics. The experimental results show that HV-HTM has a significant improvement on topic modeling, compared to the state-of-the-art models, and it can also obtain a more interpretable hierarchical structure."

F. Earp', 'Nakarin Sritrakool']",0,"This paper presents a novel Transformer-based facial landmark localization network named Localization Transformer (LOTR). The proposed framework is a direct coordinate regression approach leveraging a Transformer network to better utilize the spatial information in a feature map. An LOTR model consists of three main modules: 1) a visual backbone that converts an input image into a feature map, 2) a Transformer module that improves the feature representation from the visual backbone, and 3) a landmark prediction head that directly predicts landmark coordinates from the Transformer’s representation. Given cropped-and-aligned face images, the proposed LOTR can be trained end-to-end without requiring any post-processing steps. This paper also introduces a loss function named smooth-Wing loss, which addresses the gradient discontinuity of the Wing loss, leading to better convergence than standard loss functions such as L1, L2, and Wing loss. Experimental results on the JD landmark dataset provided by the First Grand Challenge of 106-Point Facial Landmark Localization indicate the superiority of LOTR over the existing methods on the leaderboard and two recent heatmap-based approaches. On the WFLW dataset, the proposed LOTR framework demonstrates promising results compared with several state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we report an improvement in the performance of state-of-the-art face recognition systems when using our proposed LOTRs for face alignment."

The hybrid energy-storage integration means that part of the converter submodules are built with batteries and part of them with conventional capacitors. Since traditional wind turbines are non-dispatchable generators, the integration of an energy storage system could be beneficial in multiple ways as the wind power plant could provide stability support to the grid, improvement of the unit commitment and economic dispatch, and the power plant owner could increase his revenues in the electricity market. The capacitors of the proposed converter are responsible to transfer the power produced by the wind turbine to the grid, and the batteries are only charged/discharged with the mismatch between the power produced by the turbine and the power to be injected into the grid, considering a dispatchable operation where the power injected into the grid is different from the power generated by the turbine. The medium-voltage structure could be an interesting option to overcome problems related to high currents in modern/future high-power wind turbines resulting in more efficient, more compact and lighter solutions. Modular multilevel converters are suitable to handle medium-voltage levels and they allow for a straightforward integration of energy storage systems in a decentralized manner."

This study aims to propose a favorable approach to assess the performance of Green Mine. The evaluation criteria are recognized based on the specific characteristics of Green Mine. Considering that some of these criteria could not be mutually compensated, a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is presented. It integrates the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision-making) method with the elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) method in a picture fuzzy environment. In most existent methods, the evaluation information of Green Mine is described by real numbers. However, in this study, picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs) are first used to express such information to effectively indicate the uncertainty and fuzziness in the evaluation process. Another innovation is that the entropy weights model and the best-worst method (BWM) are combined to determine the comprehensive criteria weights. The practicability and advantages of the proposed method are verified by a case study and a comparative analysis with other methods. In addition, the influences of some parameters are discussed using sensitivity analysis to judge the flexibility and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible for solving the non-compensatory problems of evaluation criteria and can provide references for the performance evaluation and management of Green Mine."

This way, reduction and rationalization of energy consumption, especially by residential users, have become a global concern generating a need for developing techniques for efficient management and distribution of the available energy. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) techniques have provided valuable information about energy consumption for power generation companies as well as consumers. Such information is important for making decisions related to sustainable use of energy resources. This study proposes an automated system based on Artificial Neural Network for performing some of the NILM tasks. A stacked neural network was developed to extract features of power signals of appliances to identify those in operation during a given period. This information is then used to disaggregate individual appliance loads through the total aggregate signal, and consumption is calculated through numerical integration. The system was tested using real data from two databases about appliances with On/Off, multi-level, and variable consumption patterns collected in low frequency. The performance metrics, resulting from identification and disaggregation tasks, demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system."

Here, we explore the potential of monocular depth estimation (MDE) based on a self-supervised approach. MDE is a promising technology, but supervised learning suffers from a need for accurate ground-truth depth data. Recent studies have enabled self-supervised training on an MDE model with only monocular image sequences and image-reconstruction errors. We pretrained networks using multiple datasets, including monocular and stereo image sequences. The main challenges posed by the self-supervised MDE model were occlusions and dynamic objects. We proposed novel loss functions to handle these problems in the form of min-over-all and min-with-flow losses, both based on the per-pixel minimum reprojection error of Monodepth2 and extended to stereo images and optical flow. With extensive pretraining and novel losses, our model outperformed existing unsupervised approaches in quantitative depth estimation and the ability to distinguish small objects against a background, as evaluated by KITTI 2015."

Challenges following the introduction of 5G New Radio (NR) include the utilization of new spectrum bands and the widespread use of technological advances such as Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) and beamforming. We propose a comprehensive and ready-to-use exposure assessment methodology for use with common spectrum analyzer equipment to measure or calculate in-situ the time-averaged instantaneous exposure and the theoretical maximum exposure from 5G NR base stations. Besides providing the correct method and equipment settings to capture the instantaneous exposure, the procedure also comprises a number of steps that involve the identification of the Synchronization Signal Block, which is the only 5G NR component that is transmitted periodically and at constant power, the assessment of the power density carried by its resources, and the subsequent extrapolation to the theoretical maximum exposure level. The procedure was validated on site for a 5G NR base station operating at 3.5 GHz, but it should be generally applicable to any 5G NR signal, i.e., as is for any sub-6 GHz signal and after adjustment of the proposed measurement settings for signals in the millimeter-wave range."

The determination method based on computer vision typically requires expensive equipment for image acquisition and has disadvantages of low recognition efficiency and difficulties in adhesion segmentation, which strongly limit the application in routine detections. In this paper, six kinds of wheat including sound kernel, broken kernel, sprouted kernel, injured kernel, moldy kernel and spotted kernel are considered as the samples. An image acquisition platform is built with low cost to capture wheat pictures. The designed two-kernels adhesion wheat segmentation algorithm based on concave-mask exhibits high accuracy, with the error rate of 0.93% for total 9988 wheat grains. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of GoogleNet, DenseNet, IX-ResNet, Res2Net, this paper studies the optimization of depth, width, downsampling mode, convolution order, attention mechanism, receptive field.

299,299,New Overcurrent Relay Coordination Method Through Time Intervals to Enhance Microgrid Protection,/document/9648208/,2021,"['Yendry González', 'Arturo Conde']",0,"This paper presents a method to protect microgrids (MGs) through coordination of directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs). The new formulation is subjected to restrictions of pre-established time intervals to guarantee the primary and backup functions of each relay. Traditional DOCR coordination is made according to the time operation sequence for the primary and backup functions, resulting in a functional dependence between the relays. Thus, slow relays affect the neighbor relays, increasing the operating time. The new coordination method has advantages over the conventional coordination because functional independence between the relays is achieved. It is only necessary to update the setting in the relays affected by contingencies, topological changes, or during the formation of islands. The use of non-conventional curves is considered to give the flexibility necessary to meet the time intervals at each required location. Based on the results, the proposed coordination method reduces the operation time of the relays compared with that under the conventional coordination method in the power systems studied. Further simplification in the relay adjustment process under the different contingencies studied was obtained, which improved under the various operating conditions in the test systems."

In particular, the effect of starlight passing through atmospheric turbulence is modeled as multipath fading communication channels. The problem is then transformed into channel equalization in space and time domains to produce a sharp stellar image. This approach involves first estimating the center of a blurred stellar image. Next, linear regression obtains an equivalent two-dimensional channel response through decomposition of the blurred image into the weighted sum of the diffraction-limited patterns in the spatial domain. Finally, an alignment algorithm is implemented for synthesis, and a final output is generated. Experiments were performed with real field-captured images; the results revealed that this approach could be used to effectively correct image blur and obtain diffraction-limited stellar images."

Many machine learning-based approaches have been proposed that automatically classify abnormal gait patterns using various sensors, such as inertial sensors, depth cameras and foot pressure plates. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based abnormal gait classification method employing both a 3D skeleton (obtained with a depth camera) and plantar foot pressure. We collected skeleton and foot pressure data simultaneously for 1 normal and 5 pathological (antalgic, lurching, steppage, stiff-legged, and Trendelenburg) gaits and classified them by using a multimodal hybrid model fed both data types together. In the proposed method, we fed the sequential skeleton and average foot pressure data into recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoding layers and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoding layers, respectively, to effectively extract features from different data types. Their output features were concatenated and fed to fully connected layers for classification. The pressure-based and skeleton-based single-modal models achieved classification accuracies of 68.82% and 93.40%, respectively. The proposed multimodal hybrid model showed improved performance with an accuracy of 95.66%. We fine-tuned the hybrid model by applying a 3-step training methodology and ultimately increased the accuracy to 97.60%. This study indicates that the integrated features of the skeleton and foot pressure data represent both the spatiotemporal motion information and weight distribution, so data fusion can generate a positive effect in pathological gait classification."

These convolutional neural network solutions rely heavily on the performance of the hardware. However, due to privacy issues or the network instability, we need to run convolutional neural networks on embedded platforms. Critical challenges will be raised by limited hardware resources on the embedded platform. In this paper, we design and implement an embedded inference framework to accelerate the inference of the convolutional neural network on the embedded platform. For this, we first analyzed the time-consuming layers in the inference process of the network, and then we design optimization methods for these layers. Also, we design a memory pool specifically for neural networks. Our experimental results show that our embedded inference framework can run a classification model MobileNet in 80ms and a detection model MobileNet-SSD in 155ms on Firefly-RK3399 development board."

Rhazali', 'M. Z. A. Ab Kadir']",0,"Geomagnetically induced current (GIC) is a ground end manifestation of geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and space weather arising from solar activity, which causes half-cycle saturation and represents a potential hazard for a stable and safe operation of earthed high voltage (HV) power transformers. Previous studies have shown that the impact of GIC is not limited to high and mid-latitude regions, but it can also affect power systems located in lower geographic latitudes. This work presents the impact of GIC on HV transformers in the Malaysian power network. A detailed power network was modelled using the Power System Computer-Aided Design for Electromagnetic Transients including Direct Current (PSCAD/EMTDC) software. The entire network was subjected to a geoelectric field strength of 20 V/km at the northward and eastward directions. The GIC analysis has determined the most critical locations in the power network model that are prone to high GICs. The simulation results demonstrated that the most vulnerable substations to GMD events and experience the most severe GICs were those located in the middle of the Malaysian power network. The GIC effects and saturation levels of four transformers’ types in these locations have been investigated over the transmission network. Under the GIC condition, transformers were driven into half-cycle saturation and their reactive power consumption drastically increased. Thus, conventional GIC mitigation systems based on neutral blocking devices (NBDs) were proposed and connected to the power transformers to block the GIC flow in their neutral paths. It was found that the GIC protection modes in the mitigation systems effectively eliminate the injected GICs in the neutral paths and are able to prevent the saturation occurrence of the transformers."

Such services require an adaptive context-aware integration of technical functionalities with the concurrent tasks that a pilot must deal with. Advanced artificial intelligence supporting services and improved communication capabilities are the key enabling technologies that will render future cockpits more integrated with the present digitalized air traffic management system. However, an issue in the integration of such technologies is the lack of socio-technical analysis in the design of these teaming mechanisms. A key factor in determining how and when a service support should be provided is the dynamic evolution of pilot workload. This paper investigates how the socio-technical model-based systems engineering approach paves the way for the design of a digital assistant framework by formalizing this workload. The model was validated in an Airbus A-320 cockpit simulator, and the results confirmed the degraded pilot behavioral model and the performance impact according to different contextual flight deck information. This study contributes to practical knowledge for designing human-machine task-sharing systems."

The proposed algorithm utilizes feedback gain adaptation, based on sensitivity estimation, and cost-based learning. Vehicle failure within this paper does not encompass every type of failure and refers only to any situation where the upper controller or communications from the upper controller shuts down. When this type of failure occurs, the algorithm performs an emergency pullover maneuver. This maneuver does not require any form of independent control from the driver to be performed successfully. However, the highest control priority is still given to the driver if the driver intervenes during the maneuver. The feedback gain adaptation is comprised of two sections: Sensitivity Estimation and Gradient Descent (GD) based Adaptation. For Sensitivity Estimation, a relationship function has been designed with feedback gain, from the feedback gain adaptation, and changes in state error. The sensitivity of state error with respect to feedback gain can then be estimated. This estimation is done through the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method with multiple forgetting factors through the directional forgetting method. For GD based Adaptation, state errors are applied with parameters for the cost-based learning to give Adaptation Gains. These Adaptation Gains are used in tandem with the estimated sensitivity to update the feedback gain. To reduce the number of tuning parameters required in the GD method, an additional distance condition has been proposed. This condition utilizes feedback change rates and state errors, obtained from the multi-dimensional plane of the feedback gain’s change rates. A proportional coefficient is also required as a tuning parameter for this condition. This parameter is tuned by a cost-based learning algorithm, also designed in this study. Resultantly, these methods allow the adaptive feedback controller to forgo any system informa..."
311,311,Nonlinear Three-Port Representation of PAs for Embedded Self-Calibration of Envelope-Dependent Dynamic Biasing Implementations,/document/8917615/,2019,"['Smarjeet Sharma', 'Nicolas G. Constantin']",1,"This paper proposes a three-port power amplifier (PA) representation based on distinct sets of nonlinear complex polynomials that describe a combiner, a nonlinear baseband-to-RF converter and a nonlinear RF amplifying function, for processing the PA's input modulated signal and any envelope-dependent dynamic biasing signal. This novel representation of PA nonlinearities simplifies computation and renders possible analytical formulations to describe a 3-port PA system. It allows accurate prediction of the PA's output distortion components as a function of an input multi-tone excitation and a multi-tone dynamic biasing signal. The representation is intended for a context proposed, to the best of the authors' knowledge for the first time, and envisioned as promising for future mobile communication equipment - the automatic optimization of linearity performance in Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC) PAs under any modulated excitation and employing envelope-dependent biasing, through implementation of embedded self-calibration within the transmitter front-ends. In this context, the representation introduced here compares favorably in terms of accuracy with respect to Volterra-based approaches and allows a simpler characterization, while the literature often points to the complexity inherent to Volterra-based approaches. The proposed representation allows the optimization of the PA's dynamic biasing for linearity improvement from one mobile unit to another through embedded self-calibration starting from quasi-static measurements alone of the PA's input/output power. Its applicability is highlighted through benchmarking against experimental results demonstrating accurate PA characterization for multiple PA platforms under different dynamic biasing techniques. In one implementation using an industry-designed GaAs PA, it accurately predicts the dynamic biasing adjustments to achieve more than 4dB reduction in the output intermodulation distortion (IMD3).

The GaN material system acts as a promising platform; compatible with silicon and sapphire substrates. Both the carrier transport and carrier removal techniques are vital to develop the efficient platform for the integration of photonic circuits. We demonstrate the carrier removal mechanism in silicon (Si) doped GaN (0001) epitaxially grown on c-plane sapphire wafer using ion engineering of the devices. Ion-engineered regions within the active layers of the device are modelled, fabricated and characterized to assess the isolation created. Helium and Carbon ions with pre-designed doses and energies are used to irradiate the device structures. We have modelled and fabricated ion-engineered regions within the active layers and studied the carrier transport properties on said regions to isolate that particular part with either of active photonic components placed at the common platform. After ion irradiation, detailed analysis in terms of electric field dependent current characteristics, sheet resistance, carrier mobilities, activation energies, dark and photo currents under zero (ground) and multiple biases are examined to see the extent of charge leakage and to map the charge behavior under nominal operation. Device characteristics under wide regime of annealing temperatures ranging from 300°C to 1000°C are mapped to evaluate the thermal stability of implant driven isolated regions. Activation energies of implanted and parent regions has also been studied.

Automatic text summarization technology has become an effective way to solve information overload. This paper proposes an automatic text summarization model, which extends traditional sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural text summarization model by using a syntax-augmented encoder and a headline-aware decoder. The encoder encodes both syntactic structure and word information of a sentence in the sentence embedding. A hierarchical attention mechanism is proposed to pay attentions to syntactic units. The decoder is improved by a headline attention mechanism and a Dual-memory-cell LSTM network to achieve a higher quality of generated summaries. We designed experiments to compare the proposed method with baseline models on the CNN/DM datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed method is superior to abstractive baseline models in terms of the scores on ROUGE evaluation metrics, and achieve a summary generation performance comparable to the extractive baseline method. Though qualitative analysis, the summary quality of the propose method is more readable and less redundant, which agrees well with our intuition."

Furthermore, an autonomous vehicle which performs this function would be more reliable if its outputs were understandable. Capsule Networks have been presented as a great opportunity to explore new horizons in the Computer Vision field, due to their capability to structure and relate latent information. In this article, we present a hierarchical approach for the prediction of eye fixations in autonomous driving scenarios. Context-driven visual attention can be modeled by considering different conditions which, in turn, are represented as combinations of several spatio-temporal features. With the aim of learning these conditions, we have built an encoder-decoder network which merges visual features' information using a global-local definition of capsules. Two types of capsules are distinguished: representational capsules for features and discriminative capsules for conditions. The latter and the use of eye fixations recorded with wearable eye tracking glasses allow the model to learn both to predict contextual conditions and to estimate visual attention, by means of a multi-task loss function. Experiments show how our approach is able to express either frame-level (global) or pixel-wise (local) relationships between features and contextual conditions, allowing for interpretability while maintaining or improving the performance of black-box related systems in the literature. Indeed, our proposal offers an improvement of 29% in terms of information gain with respect to the best performance reported in the literature."

Most of the existing work can only identify biomedical named entities with flattened structures and ignore nested biomedical named entities and discontinuous biomedical named entities. Because biomedical domains often use nested structures to represent semantic information of named entities, existing methods fail to utilize abundant information when processing biomedical texts. This paper focuses on identifying nested biomedical named entities using a boundary assembly (BA) model, which is a cascading framework consisting of three steps. First, start and end named entity boundaries are identified and then assembled into named entity candidates. Finally, a classifier is implemented for filtering false named entities. Our approach is effective in handling nesting and discontinuous problems in biomedical named entity recognition tasks. It improves the performance considerably, achieving an F1-score of 81.34% on the GENIA dataset."

Self-driving networks possess the key properties to overcome such challenges. We present and implement a management system that addresses several elements of a self-driving network. Our system leverages intents, a policy-based paradigm and autonomic control loops. Intent-based networking allows us to formalize how an intent can be provided as input to a control loop, and how the complexities can be abstracted from the user. To realize and assure the intent, autonomic networking enables us to create Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE) loops. Finally, we execute the control loops using a policy-based approach. We propose a policy abstraction to support requirements at different levels of abstraction, and an Application Programming Interface (API) layer to reduce management complexity from the user perspective. We propose a formal policy information model to model policies across layers of abstractions and to support simplified mapping and strong consistencies among various policy abstraction levels. We have implemented our proposal and present a proof-of-concept use-case to showcase the intent refinement."

In this study, we set up an experimental test bench, which establishes LTE communication between a communication tester and a USB/LTE dongle in the presence of transient interferences. We analysed the impact of these interferences on the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the received LTE signals and we observed that the EVM evolution does not explain certain communication interruptions. Indeed, interruptions can occur for EVM values significantly inferior to the standard limits. To understand the relationship between the interference characteristics and the communication interruption, we studied the peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Indeed, the PAPR is well suited to analyse transient interferences because it evolves with the amplitude but also with the repetition of the transient. Then, the PAPR measurement can provide a diagnostic assistance to analyse whether along certain railway lines, pantograph-catenary interferences are the cause of the LTE interruptions."

One of the most popular swarm intelligence-based meta-heuristic methods is the chimp optimization algorithm inspired by chimps’ individual intelligence and sexual motivation in their group hunting. This paper proposes a weighted chimp optimization algorithm to tackle two main issues in large-scale numerical optimization problems, such as low convergence speed and local optima trapping to solve high-dimensional problems. The main difference between the weighted and standard chimp optimization algorithms is that a position-weighted equation is offered to enhance convergence speed and avoid local optima. Moreover, the balance between exploration and exploitation is carried out in the proposed method that is crucial in the swarm intelligence-based algorithms. The presented weighted chimp optimization algorithm method is evaluated in different conditions to prove that it is the best. For this purpose, a classical set of 30 unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimension multimodal benchmark functions is applied to investigate the pros and cons of characteristics of the weighted chimp optimization algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE congress of evolutionary computation benchmark test functions. In order to shed more light on probing the performance of the weighted chimp optimization algorithm in large-scale numerical optimization and real-world problems, it is examined by 13 high-dimensional and ten real-world optimization problems.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network denoising model based on noise estimation (MCD-DCNN). This model is primarily composed of two modules, the noise estimation module and the denoising module. The noise estimation module uses a multiscale convolutional neural network to better extract the characteristics of random noise in the seismic data. To make full use of the extracted features, a dense connection method is adopted between the multiscale convolutions in the noise estimation module. In the denoising module, we use multiscale convolutions and dense connections to replace the original convolutional neural network and use the residual structure (ResNet) and batch normalization (BN) to improve the denoising effect and running speed of the model. In this experiment, single trace and simple and complex profile data are used as input to simulate the real data processing environment. Finally, we compare the denoising effects of the MCD-DCNN model proposed in this paper with the current mainstream feed-forward denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) and a fast and flexible denoising convolutional neural network (FFDNet) models. The comprehensive results show that under the condition of a given prior noise level, the denoising performance of the FFDNet and MCD-DCNN models are comparable. In the absence of a priori noise level, the denoising performance of the FFDNet model drops sharply, while the denoising performance of MCD-DCNN is not affected; therefore, MCD-DCNN is more in line with actual seismic denoising."

In this paper, we propose an image captioning method which can generate both imageability- and length-controllable captions. The imageability parameter adjusts the level of visual descriptiveness of the caption, making it either more abstract or more concrete. In contrast, the length parameter only adjusts the length of the caption while keeping the visual descriptiveness on a similar degree. Based on a transformer architecture, our model is trained using an augmented dataset with diversified captions across different degrees of descriptiveness. The resulting model can control both imageability and length, making it possible to tailor output towards various applications. Experiments show that we can maintain a captioning performance similar to comparison methods, while being able to control the visual descriptiveness and the length of the generated captions. A subjective evaluation with human participants also shows a significant correlation of the target imageability in terms of human expectations.

333,333,Multiobjective Ant Lion Optimization for Performance Improvement of Modern Distribution Network,/document/9698095/,2022,"['Indah Soesanti', 'Ramadoni Syahputra']",0,"Multiobjective ant lion optimization (MALO) is a technique developed to imitate ant foraging behavior. This method has many advantages, including straightforward, scalable, flexible, balanced, and fast response. The MALO technique consists of five stages: ants perform optimization by random walking by updating their position, building traps, inserting ants into traps, capturing prey, and rebuilding traps. MALO has been successfully used to find optimal solutions to power system problems. Computer-assisted operations characterize modern distribution networks to solve complex problems. The complexity of the distribution network problem is owing to the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). A DER is a renewable energy power plant with a capacity of up to 10 MW that has gained popularity in recent years. In its application, the integration of DERs into the distribution network can cause new problems, namely load imbalances or excessive voltage increases on the buses where the DER is injected. Therefore, good planning is required to place the DER. This study proposes a multiobjective optimization technique based on MALO to determine the optimal DER location and capacity. MALO is a relatively new optimization method that has the potential to improve distribution network performance. Test cases were conducted for an IEEE 33-bus radial power-distribution network. Four scenarios were considered, integrating DER types I, II, III, and IV. In each design, the placement of one DER, two DERs, and three DERs was modeled to optimize the location and capacity. The results of the multiobjective optimization show that the MALO technique can improve the distribution network performance, which is characterized by a significant power loss reduction, an increase in the bus voltage profile, and a balanced load on each feeder."

Haber']",3,"Optimization on the basis of sustainability brings important benefits to manufacturing process as sustainable productions constitute a crucial aspect in modern manufacturing. This paper presents a new formalized framework for optimizing the sustainability of manufacturing processes. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed technique combines a methodology for selecting the sustainability indicators and a multi-objective optimization for improving the three sustainability pillars (economy, environment and society). While selecting the significant sustainability indicators in the considered manufacturing process relies on the ABC judgment method, the Saaty's method enables weighting the chosen indicators in order to combine them into suitable economic, environmental and social sustainability indexes. Other technological aspects, usually taken as objectives in previous works, are considered constraints in the proposed approach. The optimization is performed by using nature inspired heuristics, which return the set of non-dominated solutions (also known as Pareto front), from which the most convenient alternative is chosen by the decision maker, depending on the specific conditions of the process. For illustrating the usage of the proposed framework, it is applied to the optimization of a submerged arc welding process. Compared with currently used welding parameters, the computed optimal solution outperforms the economic and environmental sustainability while keeps equal the social impact. The results show not only the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but also its flexibility by giving a set of possible solutions which can be chosen depending on how are ranked the sustainability pillars."

To measure performance, we compare the CNN contrast sensitivity across a range of patterns with the contrast sensitivity of a Bayesian ideal observer (IO) with the signal-known-exactly and noise-known-statistically. A ResNet-18 reaches optimal performance for harmonic patterns, as well as several classes of real world signals including faces. For these stimuli the CNN substantially outperforms the SVM. We further analyze the case in which the signal might appear in one of multiple locations and found that CNN spatial sensitivity continues to match the IO. However, the CNN sensitivity is far below optimal at detecting certain complex texture patterns. These measurements show that CNNs spatial contrast-sensitivity differs markedly between spatial patterns. The variation in spatial contrast-sensitivity may be a significant factor, influencing the performance level of an imaging system designed to detect low contrast spatial patterns."

Since the gelatin samples are transparent biomaterials, they were taken as the only substitute for soft tissue in experimental studies and observation in the current studies of medical waterjet separation technology, but the mechanical behavioural difference between the two has not been reported. To verify the adaptability of gelatin as a substitute of soft tissue under the impact of high-speed waterjet. Firstly, the dynamic process of impact was described through the energy balance equation. Then, based on the principle of altering a single variable, the difference of damage depth between 8 wt. %, 10 wt. %, and 12 wt. % gelatin samples and porcine liver tissue under various impact pressure, impact distance, and waterjet speed of motion (as opposed to flow velocity) was compared. The results show that the gelatin sample replicates the damage behaviour of porcine liver samples under the specific waterjet impact conditions, and the direction of the waterjet hydraulic power optimisation of the two materials is also consistent: however, due to the different sampling sites and anisotropy of porcine liver samples, the mechanical response of soft tissue under high-speed waterjet impact cannot be fully expressed by gelatin samples. The experimental results can provide support for the further study of medical waterjet separation technology."

Recently, the advent of software-defined networking (SDN) technology enables centralized management and operation, and the networking resources such as switches become flexibly configurable through programmable interfaces. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing optimization on an SDN. In the proposed method, the DRL agent learns the interdependency between the traffic load of network switches and the network performance, and decides an optimal set of link weights to make a balance between the end-to-end delay and packet losses of the network. The SDN controller determines the routing paths using the set of link weights and installs the flow-rules on the SDN-enabled switches. To overcome an extensively long learning process of DRL in a case of topology change, we develop an M/M/1/K queue-based network model and perform the learning process of DRL using the network model in an offline manner until it is converged. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed routing method outperforms a conventional hop-count routing and a traffic demand-based RL algorithm in several network topologies."

The platoon topologies under investigation are directed (called predecessor following) or undirected (bidirectional) weighted graphs. The edge weights specify the quality of the communication links between the vehicles in both the unidirectional/bidirectional data transfer environments. The attacker-detector game is defined as follows. The attacker targets some vehicles in the platoon to attack and the detector deploys monitoring sensors on the vehicles. The attacker's objective is to be as stealthy to the sensors as possible while the detector tries to place the monitoring sensors to detect the attack impact as much as it can. The existence of Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategies for this game is investigated based on which the detector can choose specific vehicles to put his sensors on and increase the security level of the system. Moreover, we study the effect of adding (or removing) communication weights between vehicles on the game value. The simulation and experimental results conducted on a vehicle platoon setup using Robotic Operating System (ROS) demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses."

In this work, a novel discrete transform namely Belt Linear Summation (BLS) transform is proposed. Unlike the line transform techniques which calculate the sum of pixels on a straight line in images, the BLS transform intends to determine the weighted summation of a belt of pixel values. Based on BLS transform, an automatic fascicle detection and measure method is designed.

Consequently, each user should prioritize preventing illegal access of this data by encrypting it before moving it over the Internet. Numerous color image encryption schemes have been developed to protect data security and privacy, indifferent to the computation cost. However, most of these schemes have high computational complexities. This research proposes a fast color image scrambling and encryption algorithm depending on different chaotic map types and an S-box that relies on a hyperchaotic map principle. The first step involves converting color image values from decimal representation to binary representation in the scrambling stage by changing the location of the bits according to a proposed swapping algorithm. Next, in the second scrambling stage, the same process occurs after returning color image values from binary representation to decimal representation and generating an S-box with the assistance of two types of chaotic map, namely, a 2D Zaslavsky map and a 3D Hénon map. Thus, this S-box is relied upon to swap the locations of the pixels in the color image. The encryption procedure begins with the production of three key matrices using a hybrid technique that employs two low-complexity types of chaotic map, namely, a 1D Logistic map and a 3D Hénon map, followed by an XORed as a lightweight process between each key generated for the three matrices and the corresponding red, green, and blue image channels. According to the findings, the proposed scheme demonstrates the most efficiency in terms of lowering the computational cost and shows its effectiveness against a wide range of cryptographic attacks."

It is shown that each of the higher-order time harmonics in the supply voltage produces space harmonics in a rotating magnetic flux density wave, which results in induced rotor slot harmonics (RSHs) in the stator current spectrum. The conditions for the existence of these space harmonics are identical to those applying to a mains-fed motor. In other words, the number of rotor bars of a mains-fed motor yielding an RSH-free stator current spectrum produces the same stator current spectrum even in case the motor is inverter-fed. Additionally, to minimize the adverse effects of RSHs in the stator current spectrum, one must consider not only the number of rotor bars, but also its relationship with the frequency modulation ratio of the PWM inverter. Analytical predictions are presented to illustrate these results supported both by numerical simulations of the induction motor modelled through the winding function theory and experimentally taking the case a two-pole cage induction machine as a case study."

The existing RGB-D SOD methods use depth hints to increase the detection performance, meanwhile they focus on the quality of little depth maps. In practical application, the interference of various problems in the acquisition process affects the depth map quality, which dramatically reduces the detection effect. In this paper, to minimize interference in depth mapping and emphasize prominent objects in RGB images, we put forward a layered interactive attention network (LIANet). The whole network model adopts the idea of double branch structure to integrate RGB information and Depth information. The network has three parts: feature coding, layered fusion mechanism, and feature decoding. In the feature coding stage, a simple attention module (SAM) is added, which defines the energy function considering the weights of channel and space dimensions. This module enables the network to learn more discriminating neurons without adding parameters. By refining these neurons, the high-level semantic features of images can be fully mined. The layered interactive fusion module (LIFM) is the most critical part of this paper. This module effectively enhances the cross-modal interaction between RGB features and depth features. The RGB-depth-RGB modulation feedback mechanism successfully eliminates interference in the depth map and accurately highlights the features of salient objects. In addition, we also used mixed losses to optimize further and train our model. Finally, a mass of experiments on six standard datasets demonstrated the importance of the method, and a timely detection speed reaches 30 fps on every dataset."

In order to address the need for a high-quality QA dataset in the Persian language, we present PersianQuAD, the native QA dataset for the Persian language. We create PersianQuAD in four steps: 1) Wikipedia article selection, 2) question-answer collection, 3) three-candidates test set preparation, and 4) Data Quality Monitoring. PersianQuAD consists of approximately 20,000 questions and answers made by native annotators on a set of Persian Wikipedia articles.

Our best system achieves an F1 score of 82.97% which is comparable to that of QA systems on English SQuAD, made by the Stanford University. This shows that PersianQuAD performs well for training deep-learning-based QA systems. Human performance on PersianQuAD is significantly better (96.49%), demonstrating that PersianQuAD is challenging enough and there is still plenty of room for future improvement.

Considering their ever-shrinking sizes and capabilities, being aware of drone activities in the vicinity becomes an important surveillance item. Therefore, keeping track of drones and preferably their controllers should be included into the already-existing security measures. In this study, a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) type drone controller signal detection and emitter direction finding framework is proposed to achieve aforementioned goals. Since drone communications signals generally coexist with other FHSS signals in 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, first, a method based on cyclostationarity analysis is proposed to distinguish the drone radio controller signals from other signals utilizing 2.4 GHz ISM band. Then, a variant of short-term Fourier transform is introduced to extract the parameters of detected drone remote controller signals. The correct hopping signals are then aggregated based on the clustered parameters to obtain their combined baseband equivalent signal. Furthermore, the resampling process is applied to reduce the unrelated samples in the spectrum and represent the spectrum with the reconstructed signal, which has a much lower bandwidth than the spread bandwidth. Finally, two different multiple signal classification algorithms are utilized to estimate the direction of the drone controller relative to the receiving system. In order to validate the overall performance of the proposed method, the introduced framework is implemented on hardware platforms and tested under real-world conditions. A uniform linear antenna array is utilized to capture over-the-air signals in hilly terrain suburban environments by considering both line-of-sight and non-line–of-sight cases. Direction estimation performance is presented in a comparative manner and relevant discussions are provided."

Coordinators use beacons to exchange interference and priority aware metrics. This information is later used to generate an interference graph of the sensors associated with the coordinator and perform link scheduling. The IPC approach has been evaluated for two different interference scenarios namely, a High interference scenario which considers interference from the highest interfering coordinator or sensor node of all coexisting WBANs, and a Moderate interference scenario (conventionally used in the existing literature) which considers interference from the coordinator only. Considering the mobility of WBANs, the performance of IPC is evaluated in terms of spatial reuse, system throughput, delay, and packet delivery rate. IPC shows significant improvement in all performance metrics over existing schemes."

However, in the traditional PFM with constant on-time, the resonant capacitor voltage will be higher than the input voltage during the zero current stage, leading to a higher maximum magnetic flux density (MMFD) case. To avoid this, a novel asymmetric pulse frequency modulation (APFM) with constant on-time is proposed for SRC operating in DCM, where the MMFD of transformer core varies linearly with the operating frequency and output voltage among the whole output voltage range. The high-power transformer can be designed according to highest operating frequency and the transformer turns ratio can be designed to be small. Furthermore, the proposed APFM leads to smaller peak current for all switches and fully zero-current-switching can be achieved. The output power and voltage can be still regulated, meeting the high-voltage high-power applications. For the proposed APFM, there are four different driver combinations with exact the same effects and advantages.

The phase-chirped lightwave and the multi-frequency reference lightwave are orthogonally coupled by a polarization beam combiner (PBC) and then recombined via a polarization beam splitter (PBS) to make them in-phase in one output port of the PBS and anti-phase in the other. The two recombined lightwaves are detected by a balanced photodetector (BPD), and the different order dual-chirp signals, covering six bands, can be generated in their differential photocurrent without interference components. Compared with the single-chirp signal of the knife-edge-type ambiguity function, the dual-chirp signal with the peak-saliency-type ambiguity function significantly suppresses sidelobes and shows better range-Doppler resolution performance. With the 1GHz-bandwidth and 102.4ns-duration quadratic baseband driving signal, six-band linear dual-chirp signal, centered at 10, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 110GHz, are generated by simulation, and each linear dual-chirp signal has a bandwidth of 4.1GHz, the pulse compression ratio of 465.45 and the peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) of 12.8dB. As baseband driving signal has higher (3rd) order power, the six-band nonlinear dual-chirp signals with the same central frequencies can also be generated but with increased bandwidth (6.3GHz) and improved PSLR (15.51dB). Their autocorrelation functions show that compared with the linear chirp signal, the nonlinear chirp signal has better sidelobe suppression capability, which is improve as the degree of nonlinearity increase."

The presence of moving objects in the scene will lead to much uncertainty in SLAM results, which also hinders the loop-closure detection (LCD). Although moving object tracking (MOT) is necessary for planning and decisions, it is often accomplished separately. To jointly solve SLAM and MOT for complex urban driving scenarios, this paper presents a high performance method named 4D-SLAM based on the fusion of LiDAR and IMU. The integration of SLAM and MOT is formulated as a joint posterior probability problem based on a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and is implemented with the following four sequential stages: preprocessing, moving object detection and tracking, odometry estimation and mapping. In the preprocessing stage, the motion distortion uncertainty caused by LiDAR scanning is first compensated for, and the initial LiDAR motion is estimated. In the moving object detection and tracking stage, we exploit a CNN-based segmentation network to detect the potential moving objects first, then the states of the potential moving objects are optimized by an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). In the odometry estimation stage, the distinctive planar and edge features extracted from a static background point cloud are used for the odometry estimation, and a two-step Levenberg-Marquardt optimization method is adopted to solve the 6DOF pose across consecutive scans. In the mapping stage, the mapping based on the pose estimation result and LCD are realized, and graph-based global optimization is exploited to further improve the map consistency for large scale environment. The comprehensive experiments with the open source dataset KITTI and the data collected by us show that the presented method not only outperforms the SOTA SLAM methods in terms of trajectory and mapping accuracy but can also detect and track moving objects efficiently."

The goal of path planning is to find a feasible path from the start-point to the target-point in a given environment. In most practical applications, environments have dynamic factors, such as ocean flows and moving obstacles, which make the AUV path planning more challenging. This paper proposes an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) based approach, termed as learning fixed-height histogram (LFHH) to solve path planning problems for AUVs in dynamic environment. The LFHH uses a learning transformation strategy (LTS) to improve its accuracy and convergence speed. Besides, a smooth method is employed to accelerate the speed of finding feasible paths. Moreover, a planning window is adopted to help handle dynamic factors. LFHH is tested in both complex 2-D and 3-D environments with time-variant dynamic factors, and experimental results validate the effectiveness of LFHH."

a
 with this huge amount of connected objects, the fulfillment of complex IoT applications, which usually requires a combination of several IoT objects, remains a real challenge. Besides, several requirements of Quality of Service (QoS) must be fulfilled, which makes the problem of selecting the appropriate IoT services NP-hard. In the literature, two main techniques for QoS-driven service selection are proposed: global selection characterized by a poor performance in dynamic and distributed huge environments and local selection which considers pre-defined local QoS constraints. Mainly, the existing works consider static QoS. However, in real life scenarios, QoS of IoT services can be fluctuating. To enhance the reliability of IoT applications, it is of paramount importance to consider the fluctuation dimension. In this context, we propose a QoS fluctuation-aware selection approach of IoT services. To do so, we propose a near-to optimal distributed approach that relies on decomposing the global QoS into distinct local constraints that serve as upper/lower bounds for selection while enhancing the reliability of the resulting composition by considering the QoS fluctuation of the candidate IoT services. The approach, we propose is based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to solve the global QoS decomposition problem. Then a local selection using the obtained local constraints is performed in a parallel and distributed way. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and validated via experiment series.

The sensors transmit their data simultaneously using common shaping waveforms through finite-state Markovian fading channels, and the fusion center (FC) receives a superposition of the analog transmitted signals. The inference task is computed by the FC and is based on data received from the sensors. We study the case of delay-sensitive inference, where each sensor must schedule its transmission in one of D consecutive time slots. The essence of the problem is to schedule transmissions by exploiting the channel diversity over time slots to minimize the expected transmission energy consumed during the inference task. We formulate the transmission scheduling problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with a continuous state space. By judiciously exploiting the inherent structure of the associated dynamic programming (DP) problem, we prove that the optimal solution obeys a time-varying threshold-based policy with low complexity (thus avoiding the general intractable complexity of DP with the problem size).

To suppress tremors of upper-limb tremor patients, such as essential tremor (ET) patients, many kinds of devices have been developed. On the other hand, when mechanical vibration stimulation is applied to a human muscle, sustained muscle contraction, which is referred to as the tonic vibration reflex (TVR), is induced in the stimulated muscle. In this study, a novel tremor suppression method that utilizes the periodic TVR to induce muscle contraction/relaxation to generate the counterphase motion of the ET is proposed and applied to the forearm pronation-supination ET. In the proposed method, periodic vibration stimulation is applied to generate the periodic TVR in the pronator teres muscle and/or supinator muscle. First, the results confirmed that the TVR can be induced by applying mechanical vibration stimulation to the pronator teres muscle and supinator muscle since the forearm pronation-supination tremor is one of the key features of the ET. Furthermore, the findings also confirmed that the TVR intensity that is induced in these muscles can be adjusted by changing the vibration stimulation frequency. Second, the results show that the counterphase motion of the ET (i.e., periodic pronation-supination motion) can be generated by applying the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method for tremor suppression is evaluated by comparing the generated motion with the ET motion."

In the algorithm, the interval frames of video sequence are selected, converted to gray images and scaled by sampling. With the frames, the speed-up robust features (SURF) and fingerprint features are extracted from non-compressed domain and compressed domain, and then the extracted features are fused. Next, K-means method is used to cluster the fused features, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is introduced to map the clusters to realize cohesion within classes and looseness among classes.

Shortcut Inception Modules (SIMs) and residual skip connection are employed to the generator network to increase the ability of the training and testing of the neural network. An asymmetric convolution has been applied instead of traditional convolution layers to decrease the number of training parameters without performance penalty in terms of detection accuracy. In the training phase, the generator network was trained to generate the normal events and attempt to make the generated image and the ground truth to be similar. A multi-scale U-Net kept useful features of an image that were lost during training caused by the convolution operator.

In open surgery, surgeons can obtain information by palpating the tissue with their fingers. In minimally invasive surgery, where the natural sense of touch is restricted, surgeons can rely on haptic information provided by haptic devices to determine the tumor characteristics. Tactile feedback is a promising representation modality for providing haptic information intuitively to surgeons during tissue palpation. In this paper, we propose a palpation strategy using tactile feedback to determine the tumor depth and size. For the palpation strategy, the tumor depth was determined by detecting the presence of the tumor at a given indentation depth of the sensor. Tumor size may be obtained by localizing the tumor edges. Fundamental experiments were conducted to investigate the use of contact force components in determining tumor features using the proposed strategy. The results indicated that the normal force is more useful in estimating the indentation depth, and the shear force is highly effective in detecting tumor regions and edges. Users’ ability to characterize the tumor using tactile feedback from our developed tactile display was demonstrated through tissue palpation tasks. Participants who received both normal force and shear force feedback could identify the depth and size of the embedded tumor with 66 % and 65 % accuracy, respectively. These results suggest that tactile displays that provide normal and shear force feedback can be successfully used for tumor characterization."

The rapid growth of educational data indicates traditional processing methods may have limitations and distortion. Therefore, reconstructing the research technology of data mining in the education field has become increasingly prominent. In order to avoid unreasonable evaluation results and monitor the students’ future performance in advance, this paper comprehensively uses the relevant theories of clustering, discrimination and convolution neural network to analyze and predict students’ academic performance. Firstly, this paper proposes that the clustering-number determination is optimized by using a statistic which has never been used in the algorithm of K-means. Then, the clustering effect of K-means algorithm is tested by discriminant analysis. The convolutional neural network is introduced for training and testing data that are labeled with categories. The generated model can be used to predict prospective performance. Finally, in order to validate the prediction results, the effectiveness of the generated model is evaluated by using two metrics in two cross-validation methods. The experimental result demonstrates that the statistic not only solves the difficulty to determine the clustering number in K-means algorithm from an objective and quantitative point of view, but also improves the reliability of prediction results."

Over the past few years, several energy monitoring policies have been initiated to promote energy efficiency emphasizing the active and important role of consumers to realize this goal. This study resolves the energy consumption issues of broadband networks and determines the energy usage associated with high spectrum allocation in future broadband networks by leveraging clustering from the data mining domain. For analyzing the overall patterns of energy consumption in broadband networks, this study segments the broadband networks based on the similarities of their electrical load profiles and the proportion of energy usage per hour (%) as a common framework and divides the users into different groups. The prime objective for the segmentation is to provide personalized recommendations to each group to reduce the energy consumption and associated costs thereby fostering energy efficiency measures and improving consumer engagement. The segmentation is obtained by an iterative process based on computational clusters calculation which is finalized by a post clustering analysis. Post clustering analysis involves visualization and statistical data mining techniques to analyze the energy consumption patterns and reallocating to a more appropriate group. The K-Means clustering technique is utilized for this purpose which provides the best prediction accuracy of 98.46% for energy load profiles at the spectrum of 100GHz. The energy consumption segmentation of the consumers provides knowledge and a better understanding of the consumer for optimizing energy consumption for future broadband."
383,383,Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on a Generative Adversarial Network,/document/9269971/,2020,"['Yun Wu', 'Lin Lan', 'Huiyun Long', 'Guangqian Kong', 'Xun Duan', 'Changzhuan Xu']",4,"In the field of computer vision, super-resolution reconstruction techniques based on deep learning have undergone considerable advancement; however, certain limitations remain, such as insufficient feature extraction and blurred image generation. To address these problems, we propose an image super-resolution reconstruction model based on a generative adversarial network. First, we employ a dual network structure in the generator network to solve the problem of insufficient feature extraction. The dual network structure is divided into an upsample subnetwork and a refinement subnetwork, which upsample and optimize a low-resolution image, respectively. In a scene with large upscaling factors, this structure can reduce the negative effect of noise and enhance the utilization of high-frequency details, thereby generating high-quality reconstruction results. Second, to generate sharper super-resolution images, we use the perceptual loss, which exhibits a fast convergence and excellent visual effect, to guide the generator network training. We apply the ResNeXt-50-32×4d network, which has few parameters and a large depth, to calculate the loss to obtain a reconstructed super-resolution image that is highly realistic. Finally, we introduce the Wasserstein distance into the discriminator network to enhance the discrimination ability and stability of the model. Specifically, this distance is employed to eliminate the activation function in the last layer of the network and avoid the use of the logarithm in calculating the loss function. Extensive experiments on the DIV2K, Set5, Set14, and BSD100 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model."

In this paper, based on proximity perspective, the influence mechanism model of alliance partner features on firms’ dual innovation is constructed. Analyzing questionnaires and patent data of high-tech firms, it is found that (1) Technological proximity (TP) has a positive impact on focal firms’ exploratory innovation (EXR) and exploitative innovation (EXI); (2) Knowledge coupling (KC) mediates the relationship between TP and dual innovation; (3) Social proximity (SP) positively moderates the relationship between TP and dual innovation, and positively moderates the relationship between TP and KC; Meanwhile, (4) there is a moderating effect of different levels of SP on the magnitude of the mediating effect of KC.

Masoud'],0,"This paper tackles the issue of real-time parametric estimation of a wide class of probability density functions from limited datasets. This type of estimation addresses recent applications that require joint sensing and actuation. The suggested estimator operates in the nonlinear subspace that the parameter space of the distribution creates in the measurement sample space. This enables the estimator to embed 
 a 
 
priori
 available information about the distribution in the computations to produce parameter estimates that are induced by signal components belonging only to the correct class of density functions being considered. It also enables it to nullify the effect of those components that do not belong to this class on the estimation process. The estimator can, with high accuracy, compute quickly the parameters of a wide class of probability density functions from short data records. The approach is developed and basic proofs of correctness are carried-out for the Rayleigh distribution, which is used to characterize wireless communication channels experiencing fast fading in heavily cluttered environments. Simulation results demonstrate the capabilities of the suggested procedure and the clear advantages it has over conventional norm-based estimation techniques. The results also show the ability of the suggested approach to estimate other density functions including the two-parameter lognormal distribution used to characterize shadowing in wireless communication."

The RRT algorithm can quickly generate paths. However, the resulting path is suboptimal. Meanwhile, the ACS algorithm can generate the optimal path from the suboptimal previous path information. Then, the proposed algorithm will combine the advantages of RRT with the ACS algorithm. Therefore, it can reach the optimal value with a good convergence speed. We call this proposed algorithm the RRT-ACS algorithm. This study developed a new method for hybridizing the RRT and ACS algorithms for path planning problems. This hybridization process is carried out using one of the ACS principles: the pseudorandom proportional rule. The performance of the proposed algorithm with the RRT*, informed RRT*, RRT*-connect, and informed RRT*-connect algorithms is tested with several benchmark cases. The test results from benchmark case tests with known optimal values indicate that the proposed algorithm has succeeded in achieving those optimal values. Furthermore, statistical tests have also been carried out to verify whether there is a significant difference in performance between the RRT-ACS algorithm and the existing algorithms. The test and statistical analysis results show that the RRT-ACS algorithm has good performance and convergence speed. We also discuss the stability, robustness, convergence, and rapidity of the RRT-ACS algorithm.

The proposed method defines an error equation and a sliding surface, iteratively updates the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel parameter or the 2-degree polynomial kernel parameters, forcing SVM training error to converge below a threshold value. Due to the closed-loop nature of the proposed algorithm, key features such as robustness to uncertainty and fast convergence can be obtained.

Our protocol allows the wasted energy to be used for finding approximate solutions to problems submitted by any nodes (called clients). Our protocol works in a similar way to proof-of-work, and it makes nodes evaluate a large number of solution candidates to add a new block to the chain. A client provides a search program that implements any search algorithm that finds a good solution by evaluating a large number of solution candidates.

In this model, the performance index function based on a genetic optimization algorithm is selected, and its parameters are adjusted and the controller is designed. Then, under the obtained control law, the switching signal is designed and the range of uncertainty caused by the actuator fault is given to realize the robustness of the system. At the same time, the corresponding robustly sufficient conditions are presented. The advantage of this design is to avoid the disadvantages of manually adjusting the performance parameters, and the system has good tracking performance. Finally, taking the typical injection molding process of chemical production process as an example, the speed and pressure parameters are controlled, and compared with the traditional control method, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified."

Compared with the traditional IoT, fog-enhanced IoT can offer a higher level of efficiency and stronger security by providing local data pre-processing, filtering, and forwarding mechanisms. However, fog-enhanced IoT faces some security and privacy challenges, since fog nodes are deployed at the network edge and may not be fully trustable. In this paper, we present a new privacy-preserving subset aggregation scheme, called PPSA, in fog-enhanced IoT scenarios, that enables a query user to gain the sum of data from a subset of IoT devices. To identify the subset, inner product similarity of the normalized vectors in the query user side and each IoT device is securely computed. If the inner product is greater than the user's specified threshold, IoT device's data will be privately aggregated to form the final response. To successfully launch privacy-preserving subset aggregation in the proposed scheme, we employ the Paillier homomorphic encryption to encrypt user's attribute vector, similarity threshold, IoT end-devices' data, as well as the intermediate results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to address the privacy-preserving subset aggregation in fog-enhanced IoT. We analyze and extensively evaluate the efficiency and security of the proposed PPSA scheme, and the detailed analysis and results indicate that our proposed PPSA scheme can practically achieve privacy-preserving subset aggregation with significant communication and computational cost saving."

The reliability can be described by the minimum Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) margin which depends on launch power, the gain of Few-Mode Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (FM-EDFA), and the nonlinear impairments of Few-Mode Fiber (FMF). In this paper, we develop the Enhanced Gaussian Noise (EGN) nonlinear model for FMF, which can be used in both weak and strong coupling regimes.

Based on our proposed EGN model, we address the problem of joint optimized power and gain allocation based on minimum SNR margin maximization when accounting for practical FM-EDFA constraints such as saturation power and maximum gain. The problem is solved using a convex optimization approach and considering different scenarios such as the best equal power, optimized power, and joint optimized power and gain. Results demonstrate that the minimum SNR margin improvement for the joint optimized power and gain allocation compared to the best equal power allocation is

However, care robots have yet to be widely adopted owing to cost constraints and anxiety issues due to several factors. For instance, care robots are required to have higher functionality than general care devices. It is important to provide both massive power and the appropriate support for the user’s state. However, this requires more sensors to obtain detailed information for user-state estimation and more actuators for physical support, increasing the cost and risk of failure. In a system that has many sensors and operates based on detailed data, the problem of user privacy also emerges. The risk of personal information leakage and the feeling of being monitored increase user discomfort. To support standing up and prevent falling during walking, care robots are required to apply power to the user according to the user state. The position of the center of gravity (CoG) has been used for such state estimation; however, many sensors are required to determine the accurate CoG position. To reduce the number of sensors required for user state estimation, we proposed a method for calculating CoG candidates, and validated the proposed method via experiments. Previous studies have focused solely on normal standing-up motion. However, in daily activities, standing up, walking, and sitting down are a set of motions. In addition, it is not always true that the care robot user can move normally; hence, anomaly detection is beneficial in care robots. Therefore, it is important to estimate the user state considering not only standing-up motion, but also walking and sitting down, as well as any anomaly that may occur during these motions. In this study, we develop an elderly support system that can assist in standing, walking, and sitting based on user state estimation.

397,397,Replay Attack Detection Using Linear Prediction Analysis-Based Relative Phase Features,/document/8935230/,2019,"['Khomdet Phapatanaburi', 'Longbiao Wang', 'Seiichi Nakagawa', 'Masahiro Iwahashi']",6,"Recent studies have reported the success of linear prediction analysis (LPA)-related features, which are extracted as a short-term spectral feature for replay attack detection due to the advantage of the imperfection in the LPA-based signal produced by recording and playback devices. However, exploiting LPA-based signals is focused on only magnitude-based features and ignores phase-based features. In this paper, we propose two novel LPA-based relative phase features, namely, linear prediction residual-based relative phase (LPR-RP) and linear prediction analysis estimated speech-based relative phase (LPAES-RP). The key idea of both LPR-RP and LPAES-RP is to extract the phase information based on LPA-based signals. In the LPR-RP feature, we modify the relative phase (RP) feature extraction using a linear prediction residual (LPR) derived from the difference between the original/raw speech and LPA estimated speech signal (LPAES) instead of the original/raw speech signal. LPES-RP feature exploits the LPAES signal to replace the original/raw speech signal. Because the trace of the recording and playback device artifacts is the primary evidence for detecting the replayed signal, the advantages of the imperfection of LPR and LPAES are expected to provide efficient phase information for the replay attack detection task. In addition, using the individual LPR-RP/LPAES-RP feature, our proposed features are combined with two standard features, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), constant Q transform cepstral coefficients (CQCC) and the original RP feature, at score level to further improve the detection decision. The performance of the proposed LPR-RP/LPAES-RP feature and combination are evaluated using the ASVspoof 2017 version 2 database. On the evaluation subset, our proposed LPR-RP and LPAES-RP feature achieves a promising improvement over baseline features (MFCC/CQCC). Moreover, the combined systems of LPR-RP, RP, and CQCC obtains an equal error rate of 9.26%."

However, it is a challenge to recognize the inscriptions carved on stelae that have rough surfaces due to prolonged weathering. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method to extract engraved regions from the 3D scanned mesh of a stela. First, the uneven distribution of vertices in the mesh is transformed using a mesh subdivision method such that the vertices in the mesh are uniformly distributed. Then, surface features (depth, concave features, and local surface features) are extracted from the subdivided mesh. The depth represents the basic shape of the mesh and is obtained from the aligned mesh. The concave features effectively represent concave regions by using a Frangi filter, and the local surface features have the spin image technique applied to describe the fine shapes of neighboring vertices relative to a vertex. The mesh and the surface features are rasterized into feature images, and engraved regions are segmented from the feature images by using a FC-DenseNet. Our experiments confirm that the proposed method effectively extracts engraved regions of the inscriptions from the rough surface of a stela and it shows robustness to noisy and extremely abraded characters. The proposed method outperformed the second-best method, obtaining an F1 score, IoU, and SIRI of approximately 2.95%, 3.65%, and 7.53%, respectively."

In practice, the PMBM tracker aims to initiate the track as soon as possible and maintain the track continuity. Initiating track and maintaining track continuity are hard in challenging underwater environments without adapting the algorithm to changing environmental conditions. This paper uses the adaptive measurement-driven birth process and multistatic acoustic model-dependent probability of detection specifications. The adaptive measurement-driven birth process improves the robustness of the track initiation, and the multistatic acoustic model-dependent probability of detection advances the track continuity through the transition regions.

The mathematical model of a fixed-wing UAV is very complicated because of its characteristics of nonlinearity and large extent of multi-variable coupling. Thus, to design the relevant controller is also difficult. In addition, during the operation of a fixed-wing UAV, the concomitant various uncertainties and disturbances will make the control process harder to accomplish. To solve these problems, this study designs a variable-structure controller with multiple algorithm fusion. The design mainly adopts the backstepping sliding mode control method to simplify the complex nonlinear mathematical model, and an adaptive law is introduced to estimate the uncertainty and disturbance of the system. Subsequently, the tracking error of the controller is proved to converge to zero using Lyapunov’s second method. Finally, it is verified that the controller has the ability to stably control a fixed-wing UAV by numerical simulation and can overcome the disturbance and uncertainty. The buffeting also can be eliminated by the adaptive law."

Considering multi-metric approaches and their implicit conflicting nature, it is necessary to handle this through effective multi-objective optimization algorithms. An effective optimization can be handled using a meta-heuristic approach with a high level of solution interactions. For this purpose, firefly was selected, which is a type of meta-heuristic search algorithm. Several developments of the firefly optimization were added to increase its capability to find more dominating solutions, namely, objective decomposition, archive management, and controlled mutation for exploration and exploitation balance. This developed multi-objective optimization was designated as adaptive jumping multi-objective firefly algorithm (AJ-MOFA). Afterwards, AJ-MOFA was integrated with a clustering and forwarding mechanism (CFM). This mechanism includes three main components. The first is clustering, which uses arbitration based on the cluster head score; the second is a forwarding mechanism that uses probabilistic forwarding and the third is AJ-MOFA. The solution space design in CFM combined two variables: the first is the probability of forwarding and the second is the maximum number of nodes within one cluster. The metrics to be incorporated in the multi-objective optimizations are the packet delivery ratio (PDR), the end-to-end delay (E2E-delay) and the number of dropped packets. Comparing both AJ-MOFA and CFM with benchmarks using multi-objective optimization and networking metrics reveals the superiority in most evaluation measures, which makes them promising algorithms for data dissemination in VANETs.

406,406,Effect of Additional Transmitting Coils on Transfer Distance in Multiple-Transmitter Wireless Power Transfer System,/document/9684485/,2022,"['Seon-Jae Jeon', 'Dong-Wook Seo']",0,"Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology has been widely introduced and developed over the past few years. Nevertheless, the basic WPT configuration using one transmitting (Tx) coil and one receiving (Rx) coil still achieves very limited performance in terms of power transfer distance. To overcome this limitation, various multi-coil WPT systems using three or more coils have been studied. Among them, a multiple-input single-output (MISO) structure can provide the Rx with advanced freedom in an extensive lateral area. However, few studies have investigated how far multi-Tx coils can increase the transfer distance. In this paper, we analyze the transfer distance and lateral coverage based on the generalized critical coupling condition and system energy efficiency according to the number of additional Tx coils in the MISO WPT system. The results demonstrate that the MISO WPT system using planarly arranged Tx coils improves by barely 1% in the optimal transfer distance, which achieves the maximum output power condition in a single-Tx WPT system. To validate our analysis, the MISO WPT system with seven Tx coils and seven LCC inverters was implemented and its performance was assessed. The measured results agreed well with the theoretically calculated results."

The high dimension feature vector and the complex network structure are two major constraints to utilize the large-scale point cloud. This paper proposes an optimal feature description vector network (OFDV-Net) for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. First, a multiscale point cloud feature extraction structure is constructed to generate an initial feature description vector (IFDV). Then, IFDV is selected by a feature selection unit to obtain the optimal feature description vector (OFDV). The OFDV encapsulates the best 3D features set of the points and can be used as the input of the deep neural network for training and testing. Finally, the OFDV-Net was applied to the standard public outdoor large-scale point cloud datasets Semantic3D and NPM3D, and the overall segmentation accuracy of 88.3% and 87.7% were obtained, respectively; moreover, the OFDV-Net requires less training time, which indicates that the algorithm can obtain high-precision semantic segmentation results on an outdoor large-scale point cloud while reducing model training time."

However, most GNNs are applied to homophily graphs and perform poorly on heterophily graphs. Meanwhile, these GNNs fail to directly capture long-range dependencies and complex interactions between 1-hop neighbors when generating node representations by iteratively aggregating directly connected neighbors. In addition, structural patterns, such as motifs which have been established as building blocks for graph structure, contain rich topological and semantical information and are worth studying further. In this paper, we introduce the common-neighbors based motifs, which we called CN-motifs, to generalize and enrich the definition of structural patterns. We group the 1-hop neighbors and construct a high-order graph according to CN-motifs, and propose CN-motifs Perceptive Graph Neural Networks (CNMPGNN), a novel framework which can effectively resolve problems mentioned above. Notably, by making full use of structural patterns, our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on several homophily and heterophily datasets."

Especially in recent years, with the large-scale application of smart card and the demand of information security, the demand for high-quality random number generator is increasingly urgent. With the development of the theory of non-linear systems, the design of pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) for chaotic behavior of non-linear systems provides a new theoretical basis and implementation method. This paper presents a PRNG based on a no-equilibrium four-wing memristive hyperchaotic system (FWMHS) and its implementation on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board. In order to increase the output throughput and the statistical quality of the generated bit sequences, we propose the PRNG design which uses a dual entropy sources architecture with FWMHS and Bernoulli map. Simulation and experimental results verifying the feasibility of the FWMHS are also given. Then, the proposed PRNG system is modeled and simulated on the Vivado 2018.3 platform, and implemented on the Xilinx ZYNQ-XC7Z020 FPGA evaluation board. The maximum operating frequency has been achieved as 135.04 MHz with a speed of 62.5 Mbit/s. Finally, we have experimentally verified that the binary data obtained by this dual entropy sources architecture pass the tests of NIST 800.22, ENT and AIS.31 statistical test suites with XOR function post-processing for a high throughput speed. The security analysis is carried out by means of dynamical degradation, key space, key sensitivity, correlation and information entropy. Statistical tests and security analysis show that it has good pseudorandom characteristics and can be used in chaos-based cryptographic applications at hardware or software implementation."

The slant polarization is achieved by four angled slots etched around the outer cylinder of the oversized coaxial cable. An internal compact axis-symmetric feeding network connects primary apertures to form the omnidirectional antenna. Simulations and measurements demonstrate that the antenna maintains an omnidirectional pattern from 2.5 GHz to 2.8 GHz, having 11.3% bandwidth (measured return loss <; -10 dB) and gain ripple of ±0.2 dB in the azimuth plane, which leads to the stable operational coverage. Another benefit of this structure is its polarization purity. The cross-polarization levels are below -14dB over the whole bandwidth. Move over; it is ruggedized DC short, self-supporting, and surface-mountable structure. Furthermore, compact and conformal shape reduces aerodynamic drag and makes this antenna a potential candidate for mounting vehicle systems too."

The current research handles settlement similar to a centralized market that it is not necessarily the best solution for blockchain. Nonetheless, the settlement is essential as sellers and buyers perceive the attractiveness of the local trading through the market results. In this paper, we propose two novel and efficient settlement mechanisms (Global Balancing Settlement GBS and Splitting Settlement SS) for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) electricity exchange enhancing the performance of the classic Pairwise Settlement PS. These will be written as stored procedures embedded into the smart contracts along with auctioning procedures. The simulations are performed using a small residential community with 30% of the electricity that can be locally traded to lower the bills and unstress the public grid. The performance of the two proposed settlement methods is proved by the 14 scenarios that thoroughly indicate that GBS and SS provide better results for both sellers and buyers than PS. In the reference scenario, with GBS, sellers have the highest encashments with almost 4% more, whereas buyers encounter the lowest payments with almost 5% less than in case of the classic settlement. Starting from reference scenario, alternative scenarios are envisioned to extend the analyses and assess the performance of the settlement mechanisms. The highest gain is recorded with GBS mechanism: almost 8.8% for sellers and 6.5% for buyers. Another interesting outcome is that GBS is providing better results than SS. When deviations are small, SS provides almost 6% gain for both sellers and buyers, but when they increase, the gain is exceedingly small or none."

Nevertheless, food image analysis using multispectral imaging systems(MISs) has not been applied to oil reheating analysis despite their vast application in rapid food quality screening. To that end, the paper discusses the application of a low-cost MSI to estimate the ‘reheat cycle count classes’ (number of times an oil sample is recursively heated) and identify ‘critical classes’ at which substantial changes in the oil sample have materialized. Firstly, the reheat cycle count class is estimated with Bhattacharyya distance between the reheated and a pure oil sample as the input. The classification was performed using a support vector machine classifier that resulted in an accuracy of 83.34% for reheat cycle count identification. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering procedure was introduced using a modified spectral clustering (SC) algorithm to distinguish critical classes under reheating. In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to ascertain the ramifications of the reheating process with a chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of the coconut oil samples used in the experiment coincided with the image analysis results and was statistically significant (
 p<0.05

Recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GAN) architectures show great promise in addressing these challenges. To learn powerful representation using GAN architecture, it requires superior sample generation quality, which requires an enormous amount of labelled data. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Guided Adversarial Autoencoder (GAAE), which can generate superior conditional audio samples from unlabelled audio data using a small percentage of labelled data as guidance. Representation learned from unlabelled data without any supervision does not guarantee its' usability for any downstream task. On the other hand, during the representation learning, if the model is highly biased towards the downstream task, it losses its generalisation capability. This makes the learned representation hardly useful for any other tasks that are not related to that downstream task. The proposed GAAE model also address these issues. Using this superior conditional generation, GAAE can learn representation specific to the downstream task. Furthermore, GAAE learns another type of representation capturing the general attributes of the data, which is independent of the downstream task at hand. Experimental results involving the S09 and the NSynth dataset attest the superior performance of GAAE compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives."

Early diagnosis of melanoma is a big challenge, especially with the presence of color variations across similar lesion types. Automatic skin lesion segmentation is an essential step to build a successful skin disease classification system. Recent deep learning architectures significantly improve the skin lesion segmentation results. Especially, U-Net deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is considered one of the state-of-the-art models with promising performance. Most deep CNNs and particularly U-Net model utilize a single input RGB color image for skin lesion semantic segmentation. However, RGB color space is not usually the best choice to represent the invariant characteristics of skin lesion chromatic information. The selection of the optimal color space significantly affects the performance of segmentation results. In this paper, three novel variants of U-Net model with single, dual, and triple inputs, namely, Single Input Color U-Net (SICU-Net), Dual Input Color U-Net (DICU-Net) and Triple Input Color U-Net (TICU-Net) are proposed. The structure of SICU-Net, DICU-Net, and TICU-Net contains single, dual, and triple encoder sub-networks connected with only a single decoder path. Each encoder sub-network is fed with different color space of the input image. A channel-wise attention module is utilized to fuse the contribution of the learned feature maps from each encoder sub-network which is fed to the decoder sub-network to generate segmented image map. Moreover, a composite loss function is designed to improve the performance of the proposed CU-Net models. Three public benchmark datasets, namely, International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018) and PH2 datasets, are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed models.

However, most of the current BMS schemes may be attacked by quantum computers in the future because they are based on traditional number theories, such as discrete logarithm assumption and large integer factor assumption. In this work, we first formalize the notion and the sound security models of the identity-based blind multisignature scheme (IDBMS). Then we present an instantiation based on lattices, along with rigorous proofs of the blindness and unforgeability under the lattice hard assumption (short integer solution, SIS), which is considered to remain secure under quantum computer attacks.

Forty-six participants (ASD = 20, TD = 26) took part in a series of attention tests, in which social and nonsocial visual stimuli were used as target stimuli. We examined four eye-gaze measures: time to first fixate, first fixation duration, average fixation duration, and the sum of fixation count. The results show that social and nonsocial stimuli do not affect the attention of ASD and TD children. However, TD children pay significantly greater attention to target stimuli than children with ASD. These findings emphasize the strengths of children with ASD during attention tasks and the potential for the use of eye-gaze measures to identify attention impairment in children with ASD. This study thus recommends an investigation methodology for on-task attention assessment in a learning environment."

With proper transistor sizing, we can rectify the problem and provide uniformly wide noise margin values while maintaining power-delay product (PDP) low. As far as we know, none of the previous ternary inverters has been given based on a methodical transistor sizing procedure. In this paper, a systematic transistor sizing through physical equations is suggested for an existing standard ternary inverter (STI), whose original sizes for the carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are inappropriate. This paper includes a comprehensive investigation to determine appropriate values for the physical parameters of the CNFET-based STI.

To meet the requirements for high processing speed, small size, and variable image size in automatic target recognition systems, a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based parallel architecture is presented in this paper for the ZNCC computation. The proposed architecture employs two groups of RAM blocks, one of which is used for the multiply-accumulate operations of the real and the reference images and the other for data rearrangement of the reference image, and their functions are switched through 2-input multiplexers when searching at the next row. Moreover, the sum of the pixels in the searching area of the real image is computed through serially accumulating the differences between the new column in the current searching area and the old column in the last searching area using one dual-port RAM. Simultaneously, the sum of the squares of the pixels is calculated in the same way. Using the Altera Stratix II FPGA chip (EP2S90F780I4) as the target device, the compilation results with Quartus II show that compared with the traditional architecture, the synthesis logic utilization decreases from 63% to 35% and the usage of DSP blocks decreases from 59% to 39%, while the memory bits only increase by 8% and the usage of other resources is nearly the same.

Such a vision requires network congestion control algorithms to deal with sub-millisecond delay budgets while optimizing link utilization and fairness. Classic congestion control algorithms have struggled to optimize these goals simultaneously in such scenarios. Therefore, many Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches have recently been proposed to deal with such limitations. However, when considering RL policies’ deployment in the real world, many challenges exist. This paper deals with the real-time inference challenge, where a deployed policy has to output actions in microseconds. The experiments here evaluate the tradeoff of inference time and performance regarding a TD3 (Twin-delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) policy baseline and simpler Decision Tree (DT) policies extracted from TD3 via a process of policy distillation. The results indicate that DTs with a suitable depth can maintain performances similar to those of the TD3 baseline. Additionally, we show that by converting the distilled DTs to rules in C++, we can make inference-time nearly negligible, i.e., sub-microsecond time scale.

At the first level, consistency analysis is put forward after defining consistent fuzzy preference graph (CFPG) with the help of additive transitivity. This analysis further leads us to determine priority weights vector of the decision-makers (DMRs) after evaluation consistency weights. At the second level, the consensus analysis helps us to determine whether the selection process should be initiated or not. If the consensus degree amongst DMRs does not reach a minimum acceptable level, then the enhancement mechanism plays a central role to improve the consensus level by giving suitable suggestions to DMRs. In the end, the weighted sum operator (WSO) is used to get aggregated consistency fuzzy preference graph (AgCFPG) and the order consistency property provides us sufficient information to rank the alternatives."

Thus, properly understanding what and how the data are stored and manipulated ultimately determines the degree of utility, performance, and cost of a blockchain-based application. While blockchains enhance the quality of the data by providing a transparent, immutable, and consistent data store, the technology also brings new challenges from a data management perspective. In this paper, we analyse blockchains from the viewpoint of a developer to highlight important concepts and considerations when incorporating a blockchain into a larger software system as a data store. The work aims to increase the level of understanding of blockchain technology as a data store and to promote a methodical approach in applying it to large software systems. First, we identify the common architectural layers of a typical software system with data stores and conceptualise each layer in blockchain terms. Second, we examine the placement and flow of data in blockchain-based applications. Third, we explore data administration aspects for blockchains, especially as a distributed data store. Fourth, we discuss the analytics of blockchain data and trustable data analytics enabled by blockchain.

The objective of this paper is to propose an active and reactive power controller for a BESS in microgrids. The proposed controller can operate the BESS with active and reactive power conditions and realize power smoothing and voltage regulation. The demanded active power flow generated through a low pass filter (LPF) is used to control the power smoothing for microgrids. LPF design is presented based on the BESS sizing and genetic algorithm (GA). The demanded reactive power flow generated according to the reactive current calculation is used to compensate the microgrid voltage to fulfill the voltage regulation. The analysis of the vector diagram is adopted to validate the proposed controller and to explain the applicability and functionality of the voltage regulation for microgrids. To verify the validity of the proposed controller, a 1-kW grid-connected inverter is built to demonstrate the ability of power smoothing and voltage regulation.

Despite this goal, issues of resource misuse or performance undershoot may arise because of inflexible RAN function deployment and uncoordinated decision-making across different network segments. To address these issues, this paper considers full flexibility in the synthesis of end-to-end RAN services from a set of disaggregated and uncoordinated components. In particular, five design factors are jointly considered to maximize the overall network spectral efficiency: (1) User association, (2) Remote radio unit clustering, (3) RAN functional split, (4) Fronthaul network routing, and (5) Baseband unit placement. To efficiently deal with the formulated problem, we propose a two-level turbo-based solution and compare its performance with several related works.

First, most of the key information in a conversation is scattered across utterances through multi-party interactions with different textual styles. Second, dialogues are often informal structures, wherein different individuals express personal perspectives, unlike text summarization, tasks that usually target formal documents such as news articles. To address these issues, we focused on the association between utterances from individual speakers and unique syntactic structures. Speakers have unique textual styles that can contain linguistic information, such as voiceprint. To do this, we used ad-hoc analysis to explore speakers’ text styles and constructed a syntax-aware model by leveraging linguistic information (i.e., POS tagging), which alleviates the above issues by inherently distinguishing utterances from individual speakers. Our approach allows for both data and model-centric investigation. Also, we employed multi-task learning of both syntax-aware information and dialogue summarization. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first method to apply multi-task learning to the dialogue summarization task. Experiments on a SAMSum corpus (a large-scale dialogue summarization corpus) demonstrated that our method improved upon the vanilla model. Consequently, we found that our efforts of syntax-aware approach have been reflected by the model."

The Surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is one of the basic processing techniques to detect muscle activity, and also one favorable technique to estimate joint torque. In order to predict joint torque in a wide range of real time convenient applications, it is necessary to fuse sEMG signals with other convenient physical sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, herein, we use a time delay artificial neural network to predict human joint force of ankle eversion and inversion based on sEMG and angular velocity signals. We testify our method on the data recorded from 8 subjects (5 healthy subjects and 3 patients) who are on isokinetic ankle eversion and inversion. The results show that the mean Cross-correlation coefficients (ρ) and the mean normalized root-mean-square deviation (NRMSE %) calculated between the prediction and the real value for isokinetic contraction is 0.966±0.019 and 7.9% ±0.026. Compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), the proposed method can predict the joint torque effectively.

In this article, we propose a two-stage approach to address these issues. At the first stage, we introduce the task of Cross-lingual Paraphrase Identification (XPI) as an extra pre-training to augment the alignment by leveraging a large unsupervised parallel corpus. This task aims to identify whether two sentences, which may be from different languages, have the same meaning.

To verify the effectiveness of our method, we construct an XPR dataset by assembling and modifying two monolingual datasets. Experimental results show that our augmented pre-training contributes significantly to the XPR task. Besides, we directly transfer the trained model to test on out-domain data which are constructed by modifying three multi-lingual Question Answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate the cross-domain robustness of the proposed approach."

This paper presents a deep neural network with a dual-path frequency residual network and feedback modules for sound event classification. Most deep neural network based approaches for sound event classification use feed-forward models and train with a single classification result. Although these methods are simple to implement and deliver reasonable results, the integration of recurrent inference based methods has shown potential for classification and generalization performance improvements. We propose a weighted recurrent inference based model by employing cascading feedback modules for sound event classification.

One criticism against ddmin is that it can take too long to reach the granularity where it can perform actual reduction. Therefore, in this paper, ddmin is generalized with respect to the granularity by introducing a new split factor parameter, leading to the formalization of a parametric algorithm variant. The complexity analysis of this parametric variant reveals that the theoretical worst and best-case behavior of ddmin can be improved. Moreover, the results of experiments with the generalized algorithm show that the reduction can be sped up significantly by choosing the right split factor: up to 84% of the test steps can be eliminated in practice."

Based on the mechanism of resonance, a harmonic resonance suppression radical method by impedance reshaping is proposed. Thus, the equivalent impedance of the train position is significantly reduced. Compared with the traditional method of improving harmonic current, this method of impedance reshaping can not only suppress the resonance caused by its own harmonic, but also suppress the resonance caused by other trains or other unknown harmonic sources. Harmonic impedance of the train in the resonant frequency is reshaped by detecting the resonance voltage and controlling the auxiliary converter harmonic current. The resonance identification and parameter settings of the impedance reshaping control are also discussed. The proposed harmonic resonance suppression strategy is fully tested with an auxiliary converter control in a simulation trains-network system model. The performance of the proposed strategy is further evaluated on the experimental platform. Both the results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy. The application of SiC devices makes it effective to suppress the resonance of thousands of hertz. The experiment was validated in two cases. One is the resonance caused by the harmonic current of the train itself. The second is the resonance caused by the harmonic current of trains in other locations.

The generation of accurate scenarios and synthetic traces requires a precise modelling approach, and the possibility to validate them against real-world measurements that are generally not available for large-scale scenarios. This limits the open availability of realistic and large-scale traffic simulation scenarios. The purpose of this paper is to present a large-scale and high-accuracy traffic simulation scenario. The scenario has been implemented over the open-source SUMO traffic simulator and is openly released to the community. The scenario accurately models the traffic flow, the traffic speed and the road’s occupancy for 9 full days of traffic over a 97 km freeway section. The scenario models mixed traffic with light and heavy vehicles. The simulation scenario has been calibrated using a unique dataset provided by the Spanish road authority and a novel learning-based and iterative traffic demand calibration technique for SUMO. This technique, referred to as Clone Feedback, is proposed for the first time in this paper and does not require a pre-calibration to generate realistic traffic demand. Clone Feedback can generate calibrated mixed traffic (light and heavy vehicles) using as input only traffic flow measurements. The results obtained show that Clone Feedback outperforms two reference techniques for calibrating the traffic demand in SUMO."

This paper presents the phenomenon of the sub-synchronous band oscillation (SSBO) of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system due to limits, which belongs to global dynamics, and analyzes its relationship with certain limits from the viewpoint of non-smooth bifurcation, which can serve as one of the mathematical foundations of the SSBO. Specifically, the concept of non-smooth bifurcation, a power system interconnected with the DFIG and the related current limit (CL) of d-axis and q-axis in the outer power control loop (OPCL) of the DFIG's rotor side converter (RSC) are introduced first. Secondly, the SSBO phenomenon induced by the CL of d-axis and q-axis is presented. And then, the influence of one parameter on the SSBO is analyzed, such as the short circuit capacity, the fault grounding resistance and the PI parameters of the OPCL, which reveals the non-smooth bifurcation with respect to relative one parameter. Finally, on the plane, the non-smooth bifurcation characteristics of PI controller parameters in the OPCL are given, showing that the non-smooth bifurcation/SSBO may be associated with saturation of different limits."

466,466,Damping Low-Frequency Oscillations in Power Systems Using Grid-Forming Converters,/document/9625987/,2021,"['José Luis Rodríguez-Amenedo', 'Santiago Arnaltes Gómez']",0,"The increasing incorporation of renewable energy in power systems is causing growing concern about system stability. Renewable energy sources are connected to the grid through power electronic converters, reducing system inertia as they displace synchronous generators. New grid-forming converters can emulate the behavior of synchronous generators in terms of inertia provision and other grid services, like power-frequency and voltage-reactive regulation. Nevertheless, as a consequence of synchronous generator emulation, grid-forming converters also present angle oscillations following a grid disturbance. This paper proposes two novel power stabilizers for damping low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in the power system. The first power stabilizer provides power oscillation damping through active power (POD-P), and it is implemented in a grid-forming converter, using the active power synchronization loop to damp system oscillations by acting on the converter angle. The second one provides power oscillation damping through reactive power (POD-Q), and it is implemented in a STATCOM, using the voltage control loop to damp system oscillations. Both proposals are first assessed in a small-signal stability study and then in a comprehensive simulation. Moreover, two cases are considered: damping the oscillations of a single machine connected to an infinite bus through a tie-line, and damping the inter-area oscillations in a two-area system. Simulation results, as well as the stability study, demonstrate the ability of both stabilizers to damp power system oscillations, being the POD-P more effective than the POD-Q, but at the cost of requiring some kind of energy provision at the DC bus."

According to the time-varying characteristics and the node's mobility of opportunistic networks, this paper proposes a novel link prediction method based on the Bayesian recurrent neural network (BRNN-LP) framework. The time series data of a dynamic opportunistic networks is sliced into snapshots in which there exist the correlation information and spatial location information. A vector of a snapshot is constructed based on such information, which represents the link information. Then, the vectors of multiple network snapshots constitute a spatiotemporal vector sequence. Benefiting from the BRNN's ability of extracting the features of time series data, the correlation between spatiotemporal vector sequence and node connection states is learned, and the law of the link evolution is captured to predict future links. The results on the MIT Reality dataset show that compared with methods such as the similarity-based indices, the support vector classifier, linear discriminant analysis and recurrent neural network, the proposed prediction method is more accurate and stable."

In this study, equations are linearized using Taylor series expansion to provide a linear formulation for transformer loss of life and probability of failure as a function of ambient temperature and transformer loading. The proposed formulation allows transformer constraints to be incorporated in grid management applications within conventional optimization approaches, such as linear programming, and decreases the calculation burden caused by nonlinearity."

471,471,Improving Failure Prediction by Ensembling the Decisions of Machine Learning Models: A Case Study,/document/8928540/,2019,"['João R. Campos', 'Ernesto Costa', 'Marco Vieira']",2,"The complexity of software has grown considerably in recent years, making it nearly impossible to detect all faults before pushing to production. Such faults can ultimately lead to failures at runtime. Recent works have shown that using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms it is possible to create models that can accurately predict such failures. At the same time, methods that combine several independent learners (i.e., ensembles) have proved to outperform individual models in various problems. While some well-known ensemble algorithms (e.g Bagging) use the same base learners (i.e., homogeneous), using different algorithms (i.e., heterogeneous) may exploit the different biases of each algorithm. However, this is not a trivial task, as it requires finding and choosing the most adequate base learners and methods to combine their outputs. This paper presents a case study on using several ML techniques to create heterogeneous ensembles for Online Failure Prediction (OFP). More precisely, it attempts to assess the viability of combining different learners to improve performance and to understand how different combination techniques influence the results. The paper also explores whether the interactions between learners can be studied and leveraged. The results suggest that the combination of certain learners and techniques, not necessarily individually the best, can improve the overall ability to predict failures. Additionally, studying the synergies in the best ensembles provides interesting insights into why some are able to perform better."

This work studies how the distribution of CoMP-CS cell information is affected by the backhaul infrastructure in terms of both physical and logical topology. The differentiation between physical and logical infrastructure is justified in the context of new approaches like Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization that enable the dynamic configuration of the network. We consider either a Packet Switched Network with three possible topologies (namely, ring, mesh and star) or a Time Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (TDM-PON), both carrying heterogeneous traffic. To improve the convergence time in the TDM-PON, we propose a novel bandwidth allocation scheme to prioritize the signaling traffic with respect to data traffic. Performance of both distributed and centralized CoMP-CS are compared in terms of convergence delay and traffic overhead.

Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL’s smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that ST-BFL has the same accuracy as traditional FL. However, ST-BFL provides input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance at the expense of relatively higher computation and communication costs than traditional FL."

The super-energy-resolution material decomposition consists in learning the relationship between simulation and physical phantoms in image domain. To this end, a coupled dictionary learning method is utilized to learn such relationship in a pixel-wise way.

In particular, in camera-based surveillance systems, algorithms are being developed for detecting and recognizing objects from images acquired in dark environments. However, it is difficult to detect and recognize an object due to the thermal reflections generated in the image obtained from a thermal camera. For example, thermal reflection often occurs on a structure or the floor near an object, similar to shadows or mirror reflections. In this case, the object and the areas of thermal reflection overlap or are connected to each other and are difficult to separate. Thermal reflection also occurs on nearby walls, which can be detected as artifacts when an object is not associated with this phenomenon. In addition, the size and pixel value of the thermal reflection area vary greatly depending on the material of the area and the environmental temperature. In this case, the patterns and pixel values of the thermal reflection and the object are similar to each other and difficult to differentiate. These problems reduce the accuracy of object detection and recognition methods. In addition, no studies have been conducted on the elimination of thermal reflection of objects under different environmental conditions. Therefore, to address these challenges, we propose a method of detecting reflections in thermal images based on deep learning and their elimination via post-processing. Experiments using a self-collected database (Dongguk thermal image database (DTh-DB), Dongguk items and vehicles database (DI&V-DB)) and an open database showed that the performance of the proposed method is superior compared to that of other state-of-the-art approaches."

Recently, the appearance of “hard to downward-referral” have gotten more and more attention from scholars. The key step in solving the problem of “downward-referral” is to classify hospitals at different levels evaluated by the professional doctors. This paper proposes a framework to solve the problem where evaluation values of the hospital are given as q-rung orthopair fuzzy uncertain linguistic variables (q-ROFULVs). Considering Schweizer-Sklar t-conorm and t-norm (SSTT) can make the information aggregation process more flexible, and Hamy Mean operator can consider the correlation between hospital indicators. In order to take full advantage of these two kinds of operators, firstly, we extend SSTT to q-ROFULVs and define Schweizer-Sklar operational rules of q-ROFULVs. Secondly, we combine the Hamy Mean operator with Schweizer-Sklar t-conorm and t-norm, and propose the q-rung orthopair fuzzy uncertain linguistic Schweizer-Sklar Hamy mean aggregation operators and q-Rung orthopair fuzzy uncertain linguistic Schweizer-Sklar weighted Hamy Mean respectively. Afterwards, q-rung orthopair fuzzy uncertain linguistic Schweizer-Sklar dual Hamy mean operator and its weighted form are also developed. Then, we have studied in detail some of the ideal properties of these operators. Furthermore, a novel multi-attribute group decision-making approach based on proposed operators is introduced. Finally, we apply the new approach to solve the problem about the downward conversion in the hierarchical medical treatment system. This is of great significance for integrating the medical resources of the whole society and improving the service efficiency of the medical service system."

Biswas', 'Arup Kumar Pal', 'Debesh Kumar Das']",0,"Demand for small, multi-functional, high performance electronic product with less power consumption is increasing rapidly. To meet the demand, IC design has been shifted from two dimensional integrated circuit (2D-IC) to three dimensional integrated circuit (3D-IC), where multiple device layers are stacked together to create stacked integrated circuit (SIC). This results the complexity in 3D SIC architecture and increase in the number of fault-sites. Therefore, testing of SIC has become complicated. Consequently, the test data volume also grows in proportion to the number of cores in the SIC, since each core is associated with one or more tests, which leads to longer test times. Test cost of IC which depends on test time, associated hardware to test the cores and the power dissipated at the time of test, can be represented as a weighted sum of test time and the associated hardware to test the core with power considered as the test constraint. As a result an efficient test plan is required to co-optimize test time and hardware under certain power constraint. The objective of our work is to design an efficient test plan both for non-stacked IC (i.e. SIC with single chip) and 3D stacked IC (i.e. SIC with multiple chips) under a power constraint, where each chip is provided with IEEE 1149.1 architecture. An existing cost model is used for calculating the test cost. Initially we propose First fit based two dimensional (2D) Bin Packing optimization algorithm for minimizing the test cost of non-stacked IC. However, the method produces sub-optimal result in comparison to earlier reported work. Knowing the complexity of 3D SIC, Genetic algorithm based metaheuristic approach is next proposed in this paper. It is applied on several ITC02 benchmark circuits and the experimental result shows the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison to earlier works."

In particular, a comparative study is focused on four different variants of an inverter phase leg operating at 1.5 kV DC, which has not been presented in the literature yet. The first one is based on a standard two-level half-bridge built from a 3.3 kV SiC MOSFET power module rated at 450 A. Then, the two-level solution with series-connected devices inside 1.2 kV/450 A power modules is taken into account. Finally, a flying-capacitor phase leg also based on the same 1.2 kV devices is investigated in two different modes: a standard three-level operation and quasi-two-level mode with a significantly reduced capacitor. The presented study is founded on in-depth experiments: all four phase legs were designed, built, and tested in the laboratory. All versions were connected in a half-bridge configuration with an inductive load. Tests were conducted under identical conditions to test the overall performance and switching behavior for various gate resistances. In addition, different aspects are analyzed and compared in this paper, including parasitics, cooling performance, gate drivers and layout considerations, providing selection guidelines for power switches with SiC power devices in medium voltage power electronics applications."

Beyond just multitudes faster data speed, 5G is expected to serve billions of connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), with the right trade-offs between speed, latency, and energy at an affordable cost. 5G radio networks will strongly depend on using ultra-dense integrated Small Cells (SCs) beside the Macro Cells (MCs). This kind of Ultra-Dense Networks (UDN) consisting of a large number of MCs and SCs will significantly increase network energy demands. A practical method to control energy consumption is by dynamically controlling power-saving modes in radio networks. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative energy management framework for 5G UDN using graph theory. The 5G network is first modeled as a graph, then graph theory methods are exploited to determine the order of nodes at which power-off/on procedure is applied. We also show that significant power savings are achievable by considering only a subset of network nodes and thus reduce traffic migration and control plane signaling. We evaluated the proposed algorithm at different network densification levels and several load factors including two real-life networks. We also present the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the robustness of networks optimized using it. We also show that power savings up to 25% at full load and 65% during off-peak can be achieved using the proposed algorithm. These power savings increase further if no constraints are imposed on traffic migration and control signaling."

Millimeter-wave communication is therefore a key enabler for 5G technologies. Due to the high path and penetration losses at millimeter wavelengths, antenna beamforming assumes a pivotal role in establishing and maintaining a robust communication link.

The network operating center (NOC) team is to provide operationality and availability of information technology (IT) assets, while the security operation center (SOC) team is to ensure IT assets security and protect them from cyber-security attacks. The convergence in IT assets and exponential growth in cyber-security threats in the present digital-online scenario have created many challenges in maintaining network and IT assets effectively and protecting them. It is vital to break these silos and bring them under one integrated unit to effectively counter cyber-security attacks, threats, and vandalism at a reduced operational cost. Despite its necessity, the relevant literature lacks an opinion. It focuses mainly on conceptual segments instead of a holistic view of an integrated NOC and SOC architecture, limiting further innovations in the field. A systematic literature review and analysis is conducted to collate and understand current research ideas in this paper. The mapped relevant literature and our expertise have been then used to propose the implementable state-of-the-art architecture of an integrated NOC and SOC, its definition, the main building blocks and its usefulness for the organizations. Only explicit knowledge of people is considered while neglecting the tacit knowledge in automating and integrating the processes of NOC and SOC, which is the major limitation of the relevant literature.

496,496,FPGA Based Real-Time Implementation of Online EMD With Fixed Point Architecture,/document/8924722/,2019,"['Sikender Gul', 'Muhammad Faisal Siddiqui', 'Naveed Ur Rehman']",7,"Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a data driven method for nonstationary data analysis which has proven to be extremely useful in diverse applications in biomedical engineering. In its original formulation, the EMD method works collectively on a batch of data and hence is not suitable for online applications that demand continuous data processing capability in real-time. To cater for such applications, few complete field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based designs for EMD computations have emerged in recent years, yet they have found limited practical applications. The main reason could be that existing complete FPGA based architectures invariably work on integer data sets thus ignoring the sensitivity EMD to truncation errors. Moreover, these architectures mostly implement simplistic linear interpolation technique for sifting process within EMD, thereby compromising its accuracy. To that end, we develop a complete FPGA-based architecture for EMD which works on fixed point data formats thereby alleviating the main source of error in existing EMD based architectures. We also implement well established and accurate cubic spline interpolation technique in addition to giving provision to linear interpolation within the sifting process in EMD, which further improves its accuracy. Our proposed pipeline design ensures that despite implementing computationally expensive EMD related tasks, the proposed architecture exhibits lowest execution time among all existing EMD architectures. We provide examples of computation of EMD decomposition through proposed architecture for both synthetic and real world biomedical signals to demonstrate the prowess of our work."

Most of multi-objective PSOs (MOPSOs) were designed to speed up their convergence, which have been validated when tackling various kinds of MOPs. However, they may face some challenges for tackling some complicated MOPs, such as the UF test problems with complicated Pareto-optimal sets, mainly due to their neglect on the diversity. To solve the above problem, a novel hybrid MOPSO (called HMOPSO-ARA) is suggested in this paper with an adaptive resource allocation strategy, which shows a superior performance over most MOPSOs. Using the decomposition approach in HMOPSO-ARA, MOPs are transferred into a set of subproblems, each of which is accordingly optimized by one particle using a novel velocity update approach with the strengthened search capability. Then, an adaptive resource allocation strategy is employed based on the relevant improvement on the aggregated function, which can reasonably assign the computational resource to the particles according to their performance, so as to accelerate the convergence speed to the true Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, a decomposition-based clonal selection strategy is further used to enhance our performance, where the cloning process is run on the external archive based on the relevant fitness improvement. The experiments validate the superiority of HMOPSO-ARA over four competitive MOPSOs (SMPSO, CMPSO, dMOPSO and AgMOPSO) and four competitive multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA/D-ARA, MOEA/D-DE MOEA/D-GRA and EF_PD) when tackling thirty-five test problems (DTLZ1-DTLZ9, WFG1-WFG9, UF1-UF10 and F1-F9), in terms of two widely used performance indicators."

In this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Neural Image Compression and Explanation (NICE) framework that learns to (1) explain the predictions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and (2) subsequently compress the input images for efficient storage or transmission. Specifically, NICE generates a sparse mask over an input image by attaching a stochastic binary gate to each pixel of the image, whose parameters are learned through the interaction with the CNN classifier to be explained. The generated mask is able to capture the saliency of each pixel measured by its influence to the final prediction of CNN; it can also be used to produce a mixed-resolution image, where important pixels maintain their original high resolution and insignificant background pixels are subsampled to a low resolution. The produced images achieve a high compression rate (e.g., about 0.6x of original image file size), while retaining a similar classification accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of NICE compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of explanation quality and semantic image compression rate.

The LoRa network operates in the unlicensed 868 MHz band within a total bandwidth of 1 MHz divided into 8 orthogonal channels of 125 kHz each. Despite the high level of interference, this network offers long range communications in the order of 2 to 5 km in urban areas and 10 to 30 km in rural areas. To efficiently mitigate this high level of interference, LoRa network essentially relies on a Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation and on repetition diversity mechanisms. The LoRa CSS modulation spreads the signal within a band of 125 kHz using 6 possible spreading factors (from 7 to 12) to target data rates (starting from 5 kbps for the closest node to 300 bps for the furthest ones). The repetition diversity mechanisms enable the data recovery when the transmission is subject to bad channel conditions or/and high interference levels. Although the CSS modulation protects edge-cell's devices from the high level of interference induced by nodes in the proximity of the gateway, it fails to protect nodes at the edge of a given SF region and several trials are required to recover the packet. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-channels allocation policy that attributes multiple adjacent channels of 125 kHz for nodes situated at the edge of SF zones. We study the impact of this adaptive sub-band allocation on the gateways' intensities, the rate distribution and the power consumption. Our results are based on a statistical characterization of the interference in the network as well as the outage probability in a typical cell."

Additionally, to realize flexible contact and improve motion performance during the capture process, a control method combining impedance and a sliding mode is designed to make the end-effector exhibit mass-spring-damping behavior after contact with the target, decreasing movement overshoot and stabilization time. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out in a scenario where a planar two-link space robot is utilized to capture a non-cooperative target, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated."

LCBMO takes Masi entropy as the objective function to find the optimal threshold.

That is particularly evident in saliency benchmarks. Novel deep learning-based visual saliency models show promising results in capturing high-level (top-down) human visual attention processes. Therefore, they strongly differ from the earlier approaches, mainly characterised by low-level (bottom-up) visual features. These developments account for innate human selectivity mechanisms that are reliant on both high- and low-level factors. Moreover, the two factors interact with each other. Motivated by the importance of these interactions, in this project, we tackle visual saliency modelling holistically, examining if we could consider both high- and low-level features that govern human attention. Specifically, we propose a novel method SAtSal (Self-Attention Saliency). SAtSal leverages both high and low-level features using a multilevel merging of skip connections during the decoding stage. Consequently, we incorporate convolutional self-attention modules on skip connection from the encoder to the decoder network to properly integrate the valuable signals from multilevel spatial features. Thus, the self-attention modules learn to filter out the latent representation of the salient regions from the other irrelevant information in an embedded and joint manner with the main encoder-decoder model backbone. Finally, we evaluate SAtSal against various existing solutions to validate our approach, using the well-known standard saliency benchmark MIT300. To further examine SAtSal’s robustness on other image types, we also evaluate it on the Le-Meur saliency painting benchmark."

In Adaptive RAN, each base station function has its own scheduler, and multiple schedulers share common radio resources. Therefore, in order to guarantee communication quality for more users, it is necessary to control the allocation of the radio resources required for scheduling to each base station function with neither excess nor deficiency. This allocation control is performed based on the information collected from the base station functions by the RAN intelligent controller (RIC). If a large amount of information is used for control, allocation can be performed with higher accuracy, but the collection of information overuses the limited bandwidth of the network. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the information volume required for control while at the same time guaranteeing communication quality. In this paper, we propose a method that guarantees communication quality while reducing the information volume required for control by combining a required resource estimation control in a long cycle and a resource allocation modification control based on feedback information related to communication quality in a short cycle. We evaluated the impact of the proposed method on communication quality compared to conventional methods through simulation, and verified that the proposed method can guarantee better communication quality than conventional methods while suppressing the increase in information volume."

Of particular interest in the design and use of CNN accelerators is the scheduling of the computational workload, which can have a major impact on the quality of the final design. The many inherently independent operations in CNNs result in a vast scheduling space however, rendering the selection of the optimal schedule(s) non-trivial. To aid in this complex task, this work introduces a generic mathematical cost model of the external memory accesses, internal memory footprint, and compute load for CNN execution schedules. The model enables fast exploration of the scheduling space, including loop tiling, loop reordering, explicit data transfer scheduling, recomputation, and, crucially, layer fusion, which recently has attracted interest as a method to reduce external memory accesses. An accompanying open source tool is released to perform schedule space exploration for CNNs using the introduced cost model. Leveraging the code generation capabilities of this tool the proposed model is validated on six real world networks, demonstrating that layer fusion can reduce the external memory accesses by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the best non-fused schedules. Confusing at first glance however, a high-level energy analysis shows that the practical benefits of layer fusion may be overestimated if other parts of the system are not tuned accordingly."

Hill', 'Zhongdong Wang', 'Qiang Liu', 'Shanika Matharage', 'Andree Hilker', 'David Walker']",1,"Moisture in transformer insulation is a topic of major interest to power system equipment operators. Moisture plays a large role in the degradation of insulation within the transformer, impacting on the longevity and the failure rate of this crucial asset. Therefore, understanding of how moisture behaves in the transformer insulation has been the focus of many studies. One particular matter that can occur during high-temperature events is the formation of bubbles of water vapor which are released from the cellulosic paper wrapped on the transformer windings. During such events, the presence of these bubbles could lead to an electrical failure of the transformer, and so it is desirable to be able to set operational criteria which prevent such occurrences. A formula which can predict the temperature at which bubbles will form from the paper insulation can allow operators to restrict transformer operation in order to avoid such situations. However, it has proven difficult to generate a formula with global applicability that is simplistic enough for generic use. This paper assesses the current formula against existing data in literature and compares a suggested alternative, drawing on fundamental science to assist in development of both formulae. The alternative formula is based on a better representation of bubbling activity and requires fewer input variables. Finally, adjustments are suggested to the formulae which allow them to be used more generally throughout the transformer fleet, including on service-aged transformers and with alternative insulation materials."

We apply SP-factor to several data eviction policies on the hybrid memory system, which achieves better performance. Moreover, an adaptive data scheduling method (ADSM) is proposed for such hybrid memory system with HBM and DRAM. ADSM can dynamically adjust scheduling decisions based on runtime performance metrics so that it can adapt to workloads with different data access patterns. Our experimental results show that ADSM can significantly improve the performance of the representative workloads. For SQL query application with mixed access pattern, the cache hit ratio increases by 10.4% and the execution time reduces by 14.6% using ADSM compared to ARC policy."

These current harmonics could pass through the dc-link and create new current harmonics at the grid side. Thus, the effect of unbalanced-load condition on the current harmonics across the dc-link needs to be considered in the design process. Moreover, new compatibility levels and emission limits will be developed for the 2–9 kHz current harmonics, so drives need to meet these new requirements in future. These current harmonics could also be significantly affected by the load power factor at the unbalanced-load condition. Due to these reasons, analysing the effect of unbalanced-load and load power factor on the current harmonics between 0 to 9 kHz across the dc-link is vital. Thus, this paper presents an analytical approach for estimating the current harmonics of the inverter at the dc side considering unbalanced-load currents. The proposed mathematical equations are then validated with experimental results. These analyses reveal that the negative-sequence current generates new harmonics across the dc-link. Additionally, the relationship between unbalanced currents at the load side and dc-link are found as a function of positive- and negative-sequence currents."

This paper proposes a monitoring and diagnosis framework applied to coal mills in thermal power plants. The support vector regression (SVR) method with optimized parameters is utilized to detect the abnormal condition that the operating performances deviate from the normal levels expected. The support vectors in the trained models are considered as the representative operating conditions; then are used for responsible variables diagnosis, measuring how far each performance related variable deviates from its expected value when abnormal events occur. This approach is validated by three real cases from a thermal power plant, and the application results indicate that the proposed approach can detect abnormal conditions in time and accurately. Furthermore, effective diagnosis can be achieved and is validated by the case analysis conclusions from experts, which shows the effectiveness and potential value of the proposed approach."

Electrically Power Assisted Bicycles (EPAC’s) make cycling possible also for sedentary people. Standard EPAC’s are difficultly integrable into a free-floating sharing system because the battery pack requires frequent recharging. This paper studies the challenges, opportunities and solutions of implementing a free-floating bike sharing system based on electric bicycles. The analysis revolves around the charge sustaining paradigm. The idea of charge sustaining leverages the metabolic efficiency gaps to reduce the overall physical effort required without determining a net discharge of the battery. Already validated in private bicycles, the idea needs to be modified and adapted to the challenges of a shared fleet. The paper analyzes two approaches to the fleet level energy management and assistance control of a fleet of charge sustaining bicycles. Specifically, we compare a fixed price approach against a flexible pricing approach where the user can select the cost based on the pedaling effort they are willing to exercise. A simulation framework (calibrated on data collected during a large trial in Milan, Italy) assesses the operational costs and revenues of the two approaches quantifying how they depend on the design and environmental parameters. We provide and validate a lower bound in terms of usage rate that guarantees economic sustainability, additionally showing that a flexible pricing strategy can lower this bound and grant more degrees of freedom to the users."

Furthermore, the effect of the device variation on the accuracy in temporally encoded SNN is investigated and compared with that of the rate-encoded network. In a hardware configuration of our SNN, NOR-type analog memory having an asymmetric floating gate is used as a synaptic device. In addition, we propose a neuron circuit including a refractory period generator for temporally encoded SNN.

518,518,A Simple Structure Constrained Attitude Control for Rigid Bodies: A PD-Type Control,/document/9684849/,2022,"['Mehdi Golestani', 'Khalid A. Alattas', 'Sami Ud Din', 'Saleh Mobayen', 'Abdullah K. Alanazi', 'Afef Fekih']",0,"This study investigates the challenging and complicated issue of full-state constraint attitude control for rigid bodies under actuators physical limitation. Using the concept of prescribed performance control (PPC), a novel proportional-derivative (PD)-type control is introduced by which both the attitude quaternion and the rotation velocity of the rigid body are enforced to possess specific behaviors in transient and steady state. To this end, a prescribed performance function (PPF) with finite-time convergence is first defined as the predefined boundaries for the quaternion and rotation velocity. Subsequently, a constrained PD-type attitude control for rigid body attitude system is developed. The significant difference between the proposed methodology and the PPC is the simple structure of the controller making it more applicable from practical implementation point of view. Indeed, due to the use of error transformation in the PPC, the controller contains partial derivative terms and complicated functions even for only constraining the attitude quaternion. When it comes to angular velocity constraint as well, the complexity of the control design procedure is doubled. It is rigorously proved that the suggested control framework can successfully satisfy constraints not only on the quaternion but also on the angular velocity, simultaneously. These interesting results are obtained even when the actuator saturation is considered. The simulation results conducted on a rigid spacecraft verify the efficacy and applicability of the suggested constrained attitude control approach."

In contrary to off-chip-antennas, AoCs are fabricated and integrated on the same substrate where the other components of the wireless system are fabricated. This integration results in several challenges besides highly desired benefits. The most serious challenge is the degradation in AoC's key performance metrics, i.e. gain and radiation efficiency because of low-resistivity and high-permittivity of the Silicon substrate which is the optimized choice for the AoC design. This triggers a need for the use of novel methods for the mitigation of these performance issues. Consequently, a variety of such innovative methods have been proposed in the literature.

To depict the relationship between low-resolution image and its corresponding high-resolution image, the correlation of their sparse coding coefficients is introduced in the model. To compensate the information loss during the SRR, we propose a reconstruction residue compensation mechanism, in which the reconstruction residual error is compensated into the initial result of FSR to improve the quality of the final processing result. In addition, we propose different fusion algorithms for structure and texture components. For structure components, the fusion rule with the maximum absolute value is adopted, and for texture components, we design a new saliency measure to construct fusion results.

However, the hardware produced by OpenCL compilers in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can result in severe performance bottlenecks that are challenging to solve. The problem is compounded by the fact that the generated netlist details are disorganized, making them mostly unreadable and only partially visible to designers. This paper proposes an in-FPGA instrumentation method and a new framework for extracting the FPGA-cycle-accurate timing performances of OpenCL-based designs. The results clearly show that the chosen execution model for OpenCL-based designs strongly affects the timing performance when it is not properly implemented. Our framework is implemented on an HPRHC platform that contains a CPU and two Arria10 FPGAs, and it is evaluated with a wide variety of benchmarks with different complexities. After testing on the reported benchmarks, the average logic overhead for one inserted instrument is 0.2 % of the total amount of adaptive look-up tables (ALUTs) and 0.1 % of the total registers in an FPGA. This resource utilization is between 1.5 and six times lower than those reported in the best previously published works. The scalability of the framework is also evaluated by inserting up to 50 instruments. The experimental results show that the average logic utilization per instrument is 0.19 % of the ALUTs and 0.17 % of the registers in the FPGA when 50 instruments are inserted."

First of all, a series of aerodynamic parameters to characterize the hover performance of the Hex-rotor MAV are analyzed theoretically. Secondly, tests on the Hex-rotor MAV with different rotor spacing ratios (i=0.5 , 0.56, 0.63, 0.71, 0.83, 1.00) is presented in detail. The thrust and power of the Hex-rotor MAV are obtained from the self-designed test platform. In the meanwhile, pressure and velocity distribution of the Hex-rotor MAV are obtained by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results show that the aerodynamic performance of the Hex-rotor MAV is varied with the rotor spacing. Specifically, the rotor interference is inclined to improve the aerodynamic performance of the Hex-rotor MAV with the proper rotor spacing. Owing to the increase of rotor spacing, the interactions between rotors are weakening gradually. In addition, the uniformity of velocity distribution, the stability of downwash distribution and the integrity of vortex are the necessary conditions for a larger thrust of the Hex-rotor MAV. Finally, combined with the test and simulation results, it is also found that there is larger thrust characterized with better aerodynamic performance at i=0.63 , which is assumed as the best rotor arrangement of the Hex-rotor MAV.

However, classical teleoperation systems suffer from problems such as lack of natural feedback, latency, and inefficient operator throughput. Researchers attempted to address these issues by performing some of the teleoperation sub-tasks autonomously whenever requested by the operator. Nevertheless, these systems still need the operator to see the need for autonomous actions and initiate these actions manually, which is demanding for the operators. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end Stochastic Assistive Teleoperation System (SATS) that always stays in the loop, automatically detects applicable actions with probabilities, and produces visual scene estimations for each of these actions, which results in increased operator efficiency and throughput. We introduce several methods that combine ideas from Markov processes and recurrent neural networks to stochastically predict future action sequences and scene configurations with tractable algorithms. Experiments performed with a group of operators on real and simulative teleoperation environments show that operators issue a considerably smaller number of commands compared to alternative methods. We also showed that the operators can manipulate multiple robots simultaneously using our technique, which boosts the operator throughput even further. We provide supplementary video material that demonstrates SATS in action."

However, the CNNs based on U-Net used for medical image segmentation rely only on simple concatenation operation of multiscale features. The spatial and channel context information is easily missed. To capture the spatial and channel context information and improve the segmentation performance, in this paper, a spatial and channel attention network (SCA-Net) is proposed. SCA-Net presents two novel blocks: a spatial attention block and a channel attention block. The spatial attention block (SAB) combines the multiscale information from high-level and low-level stages to learn more representative spatial features, and the channel attention block (CAB) redistributes the channel feature responses to strengthen the most critical channel information while restraining the irrelevant channels.

Accuracies achieved with three types of damage exceed 90%. The signals for the test are acquired from seven different operating conditions for each type of damage.

544,544,Misclassification Bias in Computational Social Science: A Simulation Approach for Assessing the Impact of Classification Errors on Social Indicators Research,/document/9706439/,2022,"['Sergey Smetanin', 'Mikhail Komarov']",0,"A growing body of literature has examined the potential of machine learning algorithms in constructing social indicators based on the automatic classification of digital traces. However, as long as the classification algorithms’ predictions are not completely error-free, the estimate of the relative occurrence of a particular class may be affected by misclassification bias, thereby affecting the value of the calculated social indicator. Although a significant amount of studies have investigated misclassification bias correction techniques, they commonly rely on a set of assumptions that are likely to be violated in practice, which calls into question the effectiveness of these methods. Thus, there is a knowledge gap with respect to the assessment of misclassification bias’s impact on a specific social indicator formula without strict reference to the number of classes. Moreover, given the erroneous nature of automatic classification algorithms, the quality of a predicted indicator can be assessed not only using regression quality metrics, as was done in existing literature, but also using correlation metrics. In this paper, we propose a simulation approach for assessing the impact of misclassification bias on the calculated social indicators in terms of regression and correlation metrics. The proposed approach focuses on indicators calculated based on the distribution of classes and can process any number of classes. The proposed approach allows selecting the most appropriate classification model for a particular social indicator, and vice versa. Moreover, it allows for assessment of the optimistic level of correlation between the indicator calculated based on the results of the classification algorithm and the true underlying indicator."

In order to enable the robot to have the ability to switch motion modes, this paper designed a motion mode switching mechanism, and verified the effectiveness of the mechanism through experiments, which proved that the mechanism has good motion reliability and accuracy. In order to control NCUUV to smoothly switch the motion mode, a controller based on the central pattern generator (CPG) was developed. The upper controller reconstructs the CPG network in the middle controller according to the feedback information of the acoustic rangefinder. The CPG network in the middle controller has two configurations: a triangular fully symmetrical network and a hexagonal fully symmetrical network, and the CPG network can be freely changed between the two configurations according to the instructions of the upper controller. These two configurations control NCUUV's swimming and crawling respectively, so as to realize the smooth switching between swimming and crawling.

Due to the introduction of the CLS, the unit patch element becomes multi-resonant and miniaturized. Besides, the outer length and width of the CLS are one-to-one related to the length of the patch. As a result, more than 480° phase range with quite good linearity is achieved. In addition, the phase ranges are almost parallel to each other from 22.5–26.5 GHz, which signifies its broadband property. Using such

In recent years, many ranking-based clustering band selection methods have been developed. However, these methods do not consider the combination of bands in different clusters but only select the desired number of clustering centers based on band ranking to construct the reduced band subset, which may lead to obtaining a set of bands with low redundancy but little information or a set of bands with a large amount of information but high redundancy, thus falling into the local optimal solution set. To solve this problem, an unsupervised hyperspectral band selection method based on shared nearest neighbor and correlation analysis (SNNCA) is proposed in this paper. The proposed SNNCA method considers the interaction of bands in different clusters, and can obtain a set of bands with a large amount of information and low redundancy. First, this method uses the shared nearest neighbor to describe the local density of each band and takes the product of local density and distance factor as the weight to rank each band to select the required number of clustering centers, which ensures low redundancy among the clustering centers. Then, all bands are grouped into several clusters based on the Euclidean distance matrix and the clustering centers. Finally, the correlation among intra-cluster and inter-cluster bands and the information entropy are further analyzed, and the most representative band is selected from each cluster. The experimental results on two HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed SNNCA method achieves better classification performance than that of other state-of-the-art comparison methods and possesses competitive running time."

Nevertheless, there are still two problems remain to be overcome. One problem is the detection of small traffic signs, which usually occupy less than 2% of the image area. The other problem is fine-grained classification, with difficulties arising from similar appearances between traffic signs. For example, different speed-limit traffic signs have differences solely from the speed numbers. In this paper, we propose a Feature Aggregation MultiPath Network (FAMN) to tackle the problems simultaneously. First, we propose a Feature Aggregation (FA) structure to aggregate regional features from different feature maps by using element-wise Max, then convolution layers are used to extract rich semantic features. Accordingly, objects of different scales can choose the best features to improve performance of small object detection. Second, we propose a Multipath Network (MN) structure to obtain fine-grained features. The MN structure consists of three paths, extracting instance-level, part-level, and context-level features, respectively. The three types of features are then concatenated to form fine-grained features of the proposals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FAMN. Specifically, FAMN is able to obtain an average F1-measure of 93.1% in TT100K dataset, 2.9% higher than the state-of-the-art."

However, this labeling rule is not suitable in some situations. For the dependent classes, one-hot targets are not capable to represent the relation among them. The existing label smoothing methods just split the target response into neighboring classes, but it is only applied for ordinal classification, but not for the dependent but non-ordered classes. In this paper, we propose a novel labeling rule that decomposes the one-hot target into several bases to reflect relationships among classes while maintaining a balanced target space, which adopts channel encoding from communication systems, in particular, Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) encoding. Besides, BCH encoder has an error-correcting mechanism that is expected to lift the accuracy. In theory, training with BCH targets ensures improved classification performance given the original accuracy is not less than 50%. To verify the proposed method on dependent classification, we conduct experiments with two facial tasks: age recognition and face anti-spoofing. The former is an ordinal classification task, and the latter is also regarded as a specific dependent classification problem due to the varying attack types being classified as one class finally and real for the other. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves accuracy by 6.33% on age recognition and reduces HTER by 3.63% for face anti-spoofing. In addition, as BCH targets divide the original response into a higher dimensional space, that is, the model is made to be heeded on learning the delicate sub-features. Hence, BCH targets also enhance model generalizability, thus guaranteeing improved performance on cross-domain evaluations.

An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most

These features extracted from the images are used to segment the pixels into different classes in an unsupervised way. A comparative analysis is done by using multiple clustering algorithms for segmentation. Here the Markov Random Field performs more accurately than other segmentation algorithms since it characterizes the spatial interactions of pixels using a finite number of parameters. It builds a probabilistic image model that selects the most likely labeling using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. This unsupervised approach is tested on various images and achieves a frame-wise fire detection rate of 95.39%. Hence this method can be used for early detection of fire in real-time and it can be incorporated into an indoor or outdoor surveillance system."

In terms of industrial safety, a large amount of energy can be released via electrostatic discharge (ESD) that can cause severe shocks, which can be a risk to automated machines, operators, and merchandise. In this study, the ESD associated with the existing nonwoven Polypropylene (PP) manufacturing is minimized by designing and introducing a sharp-edge metal bar with a radius of curvature of 100 μm as a passive electrostatic charge dissipation system next to the PP winding stock roll. The coulombic force from the deposited charges on PP can induce a highly localized electric field (up to ~10

Further, the level of static charge associated with the RtR process is characterized using a noncontact electrostatic field (E-field) meter without contaminating and interrupting the production lines. Furthermore, the three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain an accurate electrostatic charge distribution based on the actual size of the winding stock roll, providing a comprehensive understanding of the self-induced E-field-assisted ESD during operation. The experiment and simulation indicate that 75% of the effective stored charge density is transferred through the air.

Physics-based simulations were performed to generate single-slice and 3-slice images with needle features from a range of underlying needle positions and MRI parameters to form datasets for training single-slice and 3-slice Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) models for physical needle localization. 
Ex vivo
 tissue images were combined with simulated needle features for fine-tuning. Next, the physics-driven Mask R-CNN models were combined with a previously developed Mask R-CNN model for needle feature localization to form an automated framework to localize the physical needle. To test the accuracy of the proposed framework, both single-slice and 3-slice MRI data were acquired from needle insertion experiments in 
ex vivo
 tissue phantoms. Using the single-slice model, the proposed framework achieved sub-millimeter physical needle localization accuracy on single-slice images aligned with the needle. The fine-tuning step reduced in-plane physical needle tip localization error (mean±standard deviation) to 0.96±0.69 mm in 
ex vivo
 tissue data. The 3-slice model further reduced the through-plane physical needle tip localization error to 2.3±1.1 mm in situations where the imaging plane may be misaligned with the needle. The processing time of the framework using both models was 200 ms per frame. The proposed framework can achieve physical needle localization in real time to support MRI-guided interventions."
566,566,Incremental Attribute Reduction Under Variations of the Attribute Set Based on Conflict Region,/document/9626661/,2021,"['Chuanjian Yang', 'Gang Li']",0,"In real application, the attribute set of decision systems may vary with time. How to efficiently update the reduct becomes one of important tasks in the knowledge discovery. The static methods for updating knowledge need to recalculate when the attribute set varies every time, which makes it potentially very time-consuming to update knowledge, especially if the data sets are growled rapidly. Incremental learning method is an efficient technique for knowledge discovery in the dynamic system. In the dynamic system of the attribute set variations, there exist three kinds of attribute set changes: addition of the attribute set, deletion of the attributes and simultaneous variation of adding and deleting the attribute sets. The objective of this paper is to study the incremental reduction algorithm based on conflict region in the dynamic decision system. For three variations of the attribute set, we firstly introduce incremental mechanisms of updating conflict region; and then we research acceleration strategies for calculating significance measures of candidate attributes and eliminating redundant attributes. Consequently, a unified incremental reduction algorithm based on conflict region is presented for three variations of the attribute set. Finally, we design a series of experiments which are performed on 12 UCI data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed incremental methods can effectively to update the reduct with variations of the attribute set, and its efficiency is much better than that of static algorithms."

Given only a 2D unseen facial testing image, the framework automatically infers the highlight or shadow areas in the relighted image in accordance with the specific facial characteristics of the input image using a learned non-parametric Markov random field model of the facial appearance correlation between the source and target lighting conditions. The proposed framework first decomposes the input image into its global and local components, where these components relate mainly to the lighting and detailed facial appearance characteristics of the image, respectively. The two components are then processed independently to ease the problem of insufficient training samples and to properly analyze the local contrast, overall lighting direction effects, and personal feature characteristics of the unseen subject. Specifically, the global and local components are processed by a lighting–aware classifier and a personal characteristic–aware classifier, respectively, in order to determine the semantic factors of the facial region. The semantic factors of the facial region are then used to update the Markov random field model of the facial appearance correlation between the source and target lighting conditions and to produce lighting enhancement matrices for the lighting components and facial characteristic components, respectively. Finally, the lighting enhancement matrices are applied to the original decomposition images, which are then integrated to obtain the final relighted result. The experimental results show that the proposed image relighting framework generates vivid and recognizable results despite the scarcity of training samples. Furthermore, the relighted results successfully simulate the individual lighting effects produced by the specific personal characteristics of the input image, such as the nose and..."

High performance yet low power embedded processors may be attained via the use of hardware acceleration and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) extension. Efficient mapping of the computational load onto hardware and software resources is a key challenge for performance improvement while still keeping low power and area. Furthermore, exploring performance at an early stage of the design makes this challenge more difficult. Potential hardware accelerators can be identified and extracted from the high-level source code by graph analysis to enumerate common patterns. A scheduling algorithm is used to select an optimized sub-set of accelerators to meet real-time constraints. This paper proposes an efficient hardware/software codesign partitioning methodology applied to high-level programming language at an early stage of the design. The proposed methodology is based on graph analysis. The applied algorithms are presented by a synchronous directed acyclic graph. A constraint-driven method and unique scheduling algorithm are used for graph partitioning to obtain overall speedup and area requirements. The proposed hardware/software partitioning methodology has been evaluated for MLPerf Tiny benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to software-only implementation. For example, the resulting runtime for the KWS (Keyword Spotting) software implementation is reduced from 206 sec to only 181ms using the proposed hardware-acceleration approach."
569,569,A Two-Tier Service Filtering Model for Web Service QoS Prediction,/document/9290093/,2020,"['Mingyu Li', 'Qin Lu', 'Mingge Zhang']",1,"Service recommendation technology is the key to realize the personalization of intelligent services. The recommended services need to meet functional requirements as well as non-functional requirements. Therefore, QoS-based service recommendation came into being. To perform intelligent service recommendations, matching users with convenient services based on QoS becomes an inevitable task. However, most of the service recommendation models are based on user interaction records to predict and recommend, ignoring the service-user correlation and unstable QoS values. In this article, we propose a new service recommendation model. We have performed two-tier filtering calculation on a large number of Web Services, filtering the contextual information of users and services and the instability of services. In the first filtering layer, we take the instability of QoS as an indicator to eliminate invalid services, which significantly reduces the service scale and eliminates the interference of invalid services on the recommendation to a certain extent. Further, we process the contextual information of both users and services in the second filtering layer. Considering the impact of the correlation between the service and the user, we use the geographic location information of the user and the service, and solve the combined features generated by the similarity between the user and the service to filter. Considering the sparsity of the service recommendation environment and the influence of noise generated by useless features, we use a model of factorization machine combined with the attention mechanism for computational processing. It effectively distinguishes the interactive importance of different features. We have conducted many experiments on real dataset, and the results show that our model is better than most baseline model in terms of recommendation performance."

However, the information exchanges are not always available due to the communication restriction, high system cost and so on. Moreover, it will lead to the high computational cost. To solve this problem well, the web-winding system is considered as a synthetic system with several dynamic subsystems subjected to multiple disturbances and actuator faults. Then, the methods of disturbance attenuation based distributed fault diagnosis method and disturbance compensation based distributed fault diagnosis method are developed to estimate the actuator faults.

In this paper, we propose a clipping technique for peak power reduction in orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing systems with uniform circular array (UCA) antennas. In the proposed technique, clipping is performed on digital baseband signals prior to OAM beamforming and pulse-shaping filtering, which helps to avoid out-of-band radiation and affecting the orthogonality of the OAM modes. In addition, an iterative distortion recovery algorithm is proposed in order to mitigate performance degradation in bit error rate (BER) due to the clipping. The algorithm is derived by unfolding the clipping noise cancellation (CNC) algorithm for OFDM systems into layers and by introducing layer-wise learnable parameters. Simulation results show that for a realistic OAM multiplexing system with 256QAM signaling, the unfolded CNC exhibits excellent BER performance even when the conventional CNC suffers from a high error-floor. The combination of the proposed clipping and distortion recovery schemes provides a significant reduction in the peak power of the OAM signals at the cost of only a slight degradation in BER performance."

Currently, some methods based on the computer visualization have been applied for the surface of concrete crack detection. However, thin and narrow, poor light and complicated noise are the main characteristics of the concrete cracks at the bottom of the bridge, resulting in low accuracy of the current network model applied. Therefore, the improvement of detection accuracy and algorithm efficiency is a challenging task. This article proposes a high-precision lightweight bridge concrete crack detection method based on the SegNet and bottleneck depth-separable convolution with residuals. The cross-entropy loss function is determined as the evaluation function and the root mean square prop (RMSProp) algorithm is used for optimization in the training progress. From the results, the trained model can achieve higher efficiency and robustness, so as to identify the crack position of the original image under different conditions (such as various illumination, messy back-ground, different crack widths, etc.). In addition, a comparative experiment is performed between the proposed method and the state of the art methods. Due to the addition of the feature extraction front-end on the basis of SegNet, our model is more elegant, robust and efficient than SegNet and U-Net. And our model compared with the latest methods DeepCrack and CrackU-net, the accuracy is increased to 97.95%, and the MIoU index is increased to 77.76%. In addition, we developed a crack detection system to better demonstrate our approach. To confirm the superiority of this method, we extracted the skeleton of the crack for analysis, and calculated the length, width and area of the crack. Obviously, using our recommendations, the average relative errors of predicted crack length and width are 9.65% and 8.95%, respectively."

The complexity of interpreting raw tactile information has driven the use of machine learning algorithms to convert the sensory feedback to the quantities of interest. However, the lack of ground truth sources for the entire contact force distribution has mainly limited these techniques to the sole estimation of the total contact force and the contact center on the sensor's surface. The method presented in this article uses a finite element model to obtain ground truth data for the three-dimensional force distribution. The model is obtained with state-of-the-art material characterization methods and is evaluated in an indentation setup, where it shows high agreement with the measurements retrieved from a commercial force-torque sensor. The proposed technique is applied to a vision-based tactile sensor, which aims to reconstruct the contact force distribution purely from images. Thousands of images are matched to ground truth data and are used to train a neural network architecture, which is suitable for real-time predictions."

However, in this work it is found that the SiC P-intrinsic-N (PiN) diodes are sensitive to the electron irradiation, which exerts significant influence on the device characteristics. The physical mechanisms behind these behaviors are studied by probing the production of point defects and the evolution of carrier lifetime in the SiC epilayers after irradiation. It is found that the forward current is significantly reduced by irradiation and the specific on-resistance monotonously increases with the increasing electron fluences, which is resulted from the deteriorated conductivity modulation effects in the epilayer due to the enhanced carrier recombination from the radiation induced deep-level defects, such as the carbon vacancy (VC), silicon vacancy (VSi) and VC+VSi complexes. Inversely, no significant change is observed in the reverse leakage current of 4H-SiC PiN diodes, and the breakdown voltage even slightly increases after electron irradiation, which are ascribed to the suppressed carrier generation arising from the point defects in 4H-SiC with a wide bandgap and the carrier-removal effects caused by the acceptor like point defects generated during irradiation, respectively."

In the first stage, the spatial and temporal features of image sequences are extracted by CNN and LSTM respectively, which are used to evaluate the degree of image distortion. And then the proposed model is learned to predict image patches' scores in the second stage with the outputs of the first stage. Finally, a pooling strategy that follows the human visual saliency is designed to evaluate the quality score of the whole image.

For efficiently managing the cloud infrastructure, bare-metal cloud operators need to monitor the utilization of servers. However, the privacy and security concerns prohibit the installation of third-party monitoring agents on the servers; thus, finding the server-utilization becomes a challenge. In this work, we present NASCENT, a scalable machine-learning (ML) based non-invasive solution for finding the utilization of servers without compromising the privacy and security of bare-metal cloud tenants. Our key idea is to infer utilization from various sensor readings accessible via a server’s baseboard management controller (BMC) hardware. We evaluate the proposed solution with three regression based supervised ML algorithms in a Bare-metal-as-a-service (BMaaS) cloud. Our experimental evaluation shows that one of the ML algorithms employed in NASCENT infers the utilization with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) between 2.9 to 9.3 for different workloads. Also, the proposed solution uses minimal memory resources (19 KB) and can even run on BMC hardware which has very limited memory. We also propose a BMaaS cloud architecture that seamlessly integrates automated training and deployment of the ML algorithm in our solution into the life-cycle of bare-metal servers.

st
 sheath of the roof silicone rubber composite insulator of high-speed train on the flashover characteristics. The continuous voltage rising method is used to obtain the influence characteristics of the crack on the development process of the flashover arc. The constant voltage withstand method is adopted to compare the leakage current when the contamination degree is 0.1 mg/cm
2
. The test results demonstrate that the crack has no significant effect on the flashover voltage and flashover path, and the flashover arc can burn the edge of the crack. The peak leakage current of the three different tests ranges from 24 mA to 30 mA. Additionally, the development of leakage current can be divided into four stages: rising, continuous violence, falling, and oscillating. Moreover, the sequence of the apparent leakage current of the insulator is long crack insulator, short crack insulator, and the one with no crack. The acceleration of the rising stage of the leakage current increases with the increase in the crack length. Meanwhile, the sum of the time of the rising stage, continuous stage, and falling stage of the insulator with long crack is the smallest. The crack will distort the distribution of current density and the electric field intensity in the vicinity. The results can provide references for evaluating the influence of radial cracks at the edge of the sheath on the flashover characteristics and optimizing the design of the roof insulator sheath structure."
593,593,Named-Entity Recognition Using Automatic Construction of Training Data From Social Media Messaging Apps,/document/9286444/,2020,"['Seungwook Lee', 'Youngjoong Ko']",0,"In recent years, social media messaging app data has served as a precious resource to extract useful information, such as critical clues and evidence in legal trials and criminal investigations. Although these data can be of various types, they are mostly in the form of natural language text. Therefore, to extract information from them efficiently, it is essential to research practical natural language processing approaches. This study proposes applying a deep-learning-based named-entity recognition (NER) system as a natural language processing approach for information extraction to these messaging data. In addition, a system for automatically constructing NER training data is presented using the distant supervision method for the training data of deep-learning models. Because social media messaging app data generally include a significant amount of noise, such as typographical and word-spacing errors, a NER system with robustness against these types of noisy data is required to extract information from the messaging data effectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms that of a NER system with manually labeled training data."
594,594,Gated-Dilated Networks for Lung Nodule Classification in CT Scans,/document/8930524/,2019,"['Mundher Al-Shabi', 'Hwee Kuan Lee', 'Maxine Tan']",9,"Different types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been applied to detect cancerous lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. However, the size of a nodule is very diverse and can range anywhere between 3 and 30 millimeters. The high variation of nodule sizes makes classifying them a difficult and challenging task. In this study, we propose a novel CNN architecture called Gated-Dilated (GD) networks to classify nodules as malignant or benign. Unlike previous studies, the GD network uses multiple dilated convolutions instead of max-poolings to capture the scale variations. Moreover, the GD network has a Context-Aware sub-network that analyzes the input features and guides the features to a suitable dilated convolution. We evaluated the proposed network on more than 1,000 CT scans from the LIDC-LDRI dataset. Our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models including Multi-Crop, Resnet, and Densenet, with an AUC of >0.95. Compared to the baseline models, the GD network improves the classification accuracies of mid-range sized nodules. Furthermore, we observe a relationship between the size of the nodule and the attention signal generated by the Context-Aware sub-network, which validates our new network architecture."
595,595,Flattenet: A Simple and Versatile Framework for Dense Pixelwise Prediction,/document/8932465/,2019,"['Xin Cai', 'Yi-Fei Pu']",2,"In this paper, we focus on devising a versatile framework for dense pixelwise prediction whose goal is to assign a discrete or continuous label to each pixel for an image. It is well-known that the reduced feature resolution due to repeated subsampling operations poses a serious challenge to Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) based models. In contrast to the commonly-used strategies, such as dilated convolution and encoder-decoder structure, we introduce a novel Flattening Module to produce high-resolution predictions without either removing any subsampling operations or building a complicated decoder module. In addition, the Flattening Module is lightweight and can be easily combined with any existing FCNs, allowing the model builder to trade off among model size, computational cost and accuracy by simply choosing different backbone networks. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Flattening Module through competitive results in human pose estimation on MPII, semantic segmentation on PASCAL-Context and object detection on PASCAL VOC. We hope that the proposed approach can serve as a simple and strong alternative of current dominant dense pixelwise prediction frameworks."

The antenna consists of a D = 540 mm main reflector, sub-reflector, and dual-port dual-polarization diagonal horn feed antenna. To obtain similar feed horn E-H radiation patterns, gain, high polarization, and port isolation, a dual-port diagonal horn was designed in the feed. The measured antenna gains are 50.85 dBi and the side-lobe levels are −24.5 dB at E-H radiation patterns of two ports at 94 GHz, respectively. The VSWRs of port 1 and port 2 are less than 1.5:1 in the range 93.2–95.3 GHz, which meets the working requirements of frequency modulated continuous wave and pulse cloud radars. And the isolation between the two ports is above −50 dB, whereas the polarization isolation of each port is above 40 dB. The proposed W-band antenna is a suitable candidate for the dual-polarization cloud radars."
597,597,Memory Storage Systems Utilizing Chaotic Attractor-Merging Bifurcation,/document/9703364/,2022,"['Sou Nobukawa', 'Nobuhiko Wagatsuma', 'Haruhiko Nishimura', 'Keiichiro Inagaki', 'Teruya Yamanishi']",0,"In nonlinear dynamical systems with barriers/thresholds, the signal response against a weak external input signal is enhanced by an appropriate additive noise (stochastic resonance). In recent years, progress in the application of stochastic resonance shows that the existence of additive noise heightens the memory storage functions in memory elements using bistable oscillations even with extremely low power consumption. By not restricting the additive noise, the deterministic chaos (an internal fluctuation) induces a similar phenomenon known as chaotic resonance. Chaotic resonance appears in nonlinear dynamical systems and is accompanied by chaos–chaos intermittency, where the chaotic orbit intermittently transitions among separated attractor regions through attractor-merging bifurcation. Previously, a higher chaotic resonance sensitivity than that of stochastic resonance was reported in various types of systems. In this study, we hypothesize that chaotic-resonance-based memory devices can store information with lower power consumption than that of stochastic-resonance-based devices. To prove this hypothesis, we induced attractor-merging bifurcation in a cubic map system, which is the simplest model for the emergence of chaotic resonance. Thereafter, we adjusted the internal system parameter under a noise-free system as the chaotic resonance and applied stochastic noise similar to the condition for inducing stochastic resonance. The results of this study reveal that, even with weaker memory storage input signals, the former exhibits a higher memory storage capability than the latter. The approach using chaotic resonance could facilitate the development of memory devices that were hitherto restricted to the application of stochastic resonance."
598,598,NADS-RA: Network Anomaly Detection Scheme Based on Feature Representation and Data Augmentation,/document/9269968/,2020,"['Xu Liu', 'Xiaoqiang Di', 'Qiang Ding', 'Weiyou Liu', 'Hui Qi', 'Jinqing Li', 'Huamin Yang']",3,"Network anomaly detection aims to identify network anomalies, and it has obtained many achievements using the supervised classification technique. Since the supervised classifier depends on the prior data, it is difficult to accurately classify the rare anomalies when they account less in the training set. Data augmentation can tackle the imbalanced training set problem through creating artificial rare anomaly samples. However, the existing data augmentation methods either ignore the data distribution or ignore the spatial knowledge between features. Therefore, this article addresses this issue by proposing a Network Anomaly Detection Scheme based on feature Representation and data Augmentation (NADS-RA). Re-circulation Pixel Permutation strategy is first designed as feature representation strategy to construct images, and it rotates each feature left by the times of feature number to maintain the spatial knowledge between original network traffic features. An image-based augmentation strategy is thus designed to produce augmented images according to the distribution characteristics of rare network anomaly images with the help of Least Squares Generative Adversarial Network, which alleviates the effect of imbalanced training set and avoids over-fitting. After that, NADS-RA is implemented on the Convolutional Neural Network classification model. We conduct experiments on five public benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15, and so on, and compare against 12 detection methods and 17 data generation methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our work to state-of-the-art methods and the general applicability in different scenarios."

Ardila Franco', 'Hernán Darío Benítez-Restrepo', 'Alan C. Bovik']",0,"The existing body of work on video object tracking (VOT) algorithms has studied various image conditions such as occlusion, clutter, and object shape, which influence video quality and affect tracking performance. Nonetheless, there is no clear distinction between the performance reduction caused by scene-dependent challenges such as occlusion and clutter, and the effect of authentic in-capture and post-capture distortions. Despite the plethora of VOT methods in the literature, there is a lack of detailed studies analyzing the performance of videos with authentic in-capture and post-capture distortions. We introduced a new dataset of authentically distorted videos (AD-SVD) to address this issue. This dataset contains 4476 videos with different authentic distortions and surveillance activities. Furthermore, it provides benchmarking results for evaluating ten state-of-the-art visual object trackers (from VOT 2017–2018 challenges) based on the proposed dataset. In addition, this study develops an approach for performance prediction and quality-aware feature selection for single-object tracking in authentically distorted surveillance videos. The method predicts the performance of a VOT algorithm with high accuracy. Then, the probability of obtaining the reference output is maximized without executing the tracking algorithms. We also propose a framework to reduce video tracker computation resources (time and video storage space). We achieve this by balancing processing time and tracking accuracy by predicting the performance in a range of spatial resolutions. This approach can reduce the execution time by up to 34% with a slight decrease in performance of 3%."
